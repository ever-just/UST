# Chapter 3: Introduction to Contracts

## Introduction

The case of **River Park Hospital v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee**, 173 S.W.3d 43 (Tenn. App. 2002) is presented for individual reflection and group discussion.

### Case Background

From 1994 through December 31, 1999, River Park Hospital—a 127-bed hospital in rural Tennessee—agreed to a contract with BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee (BlueCross/BlueShield) to become a provider in its BlueCare network. The BlueCare network was a managed care organization (MCO) subsidiary of BlueCross/BlueShield that provided health coverage to low-income residents as a part of Tennessee's Medicaid program (TennCare).

### Traditional vs. TennCare Systems

#### Traditional Fee-for-Service Medicaid
Under traditional "fee-for-service" Medicaid programs, a State would pay health care providers directly for services administered to eligible individuals (enrollees). Reimbursement rates for services provided to Medicaid enrollees would be established by the State. Individual Medicaid enrollees would be free to utilize the physician, hospital, or other health care provider of their choice, and likewise, the health care provider would be free to accept or decline to treat Medicaid patients.

#### TennCare Managed Care System
TennCare was a state-based Medicaid experiment established in 1994 to be different from the traditional fee-for-service Medicaid program, in that it was a managed care Medicaid system operating pursuant to a series of contracts and traditional market forces. Under TennCare:

- The State of Tennessee would enter into contracts with private MCOs (including BlueCare)
- These contracts specified a monthly payment from the State of Tennessee, known as a "capitation payment" for each individual enrolled with that MCO
- In return for the capitation payment, the MCO was required to provide medically necessary services for each enrolled individual
- Each MCO developed a "network" of health care providers and negotiated contracts with health care providers who agreed to accept discounted "in-network rates"
- **Risk allocation**: If the MCO paid less in provider fees than the total amount received in capitation payments, the MCO earned a profit. If the amount spent on care exceeded the capitation payments, the MCO would bear the loss

### The Gatekeeping Model

TennCare's managed care business model approach to Medicaid incentivized MCOs (including BlueCare) to:
- Enroll Medicaid-eligible individuals 
- Assign each enrollee to a primary care physician (PCP)
- The PCP—or "gatekeeper"—was paid a per capita rate by the MCO to perform "gatekeeping" functions intended to ensure that each enrollee only received medically necessary health care services
- Refer enrollees to other health care providers for services not provided by the PCP, such as hospitalizations

### Emergency Medical Treatment Requirements

**Important Exception**: If an MCO enrollee was having an emergency situation, he could go directly to a hospital emergency room without first getting approval from his PCP. 

Under the **Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)**—a federal law passed in 1986—a hospital is required to provide services to a person with an emergency medical condition until the person's condition has stabilized—regardless of whether the person has insurance. The MCO also has obligations pursuant to its contract with the state to pay the health care provider for any emergency services provided to its enrollee.

### The Dispute

During the approximate six-year course of River Park Hospital's contractual relationship with BlueCare, River Park became dissatisfied with:
- The low rates of reimbursement paid by BlueCare
- The amount of time and money required to follow BlueCare's elaborate "utilization management procedures," which were required in order for River Park to obtain payment for services rendered

**Financial Impact**: During 1999—the final year of its contract with BlueCare—River Park lost $2.3 million on its BlueCare enrollees, and attempts at re-negotiating the terms of the contract were not successful.

### Post-Contract Expiration

Beginning January 1, 2000:
- River Park became an "out-of-network provider" for BlueCare enrollees
- River Park informed BlueCare that it would not be bound by the terms of the now-expired contract
- River Park told BlueCare that it would charge the hospital's reasonable, standard rates for any services provided to BlueCare enrollees
- BlueCare informed River Park that it had a policy of paying out-of-network hospitals the same rate as in-network hospitals
- River Park began directing all non-emergency BlueCare patients to other healthcare facilities

### Emergency Services Conflict

Between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2000, there were **1,799 visits** by BlueCare enrollees to River Park's emergency room. Because of the federal EMTALA requirements, River Park was required to provide emergency services until these BlueCare patients were stabilized.

**The Legal Issue**: 
- River Park billed BlueCare its full, standard rates for emergency services
- BlueCare refused to pay River Park's standard rates, instead paying the same rate it had paid under the parties' expired contract
- BlueCare justified its decision on the basis of an ambiguous regulatory provision in Tennessee law and what it termed consistent industry custom for other MCOs in Tennessee

River Park sued BlueCare to recover the difference between what it charged and the lower amount that BlueCare actually reimbursed.

## Discussion Questions

1. **What difference do you think it should make—legally—that a contract once existed, but has now expired?**

2. **Is it fair, or ethical, for BlueCare to determine unilaterally what it will pay for healthcare services River Park is legally required to provide? Why or why not?**

3. **If you were the judge responsible for determining a resolution to this dispute, how would you rule?**

# I. What Is a Contract?

Contracts are perhaps the most important topic in business law. Contracts are everywhere, and shape all business relationships. 

## Examples of Contracts in Business
- How does an employer hire an employee? Through a contract
- How does a manufacturer obtain a part? Through a contract
- How does a customer buy a good? Through a contract
- How does a doctor get a patient? Through a contract

## Two Ways to Think About Contracts

### 1. Formalized Promises
One way to look at contracts is to think about them as formalized promises. A doctor promises to use her best judgment to treat a patient, and the patient promises to pay the doctor's reasonable fee.

### 2. Memorialization of a Relationship
Beyond promises, another way to think about a contract is that it is a memorialization of a relationship. The contract establishes the rights and responsibilities of the parties.

## Types of Contracts

### Express Contracts
In an express contract, the parties assent to the terms of the contract by means of words, writings, or some other mode of expression.

### Contracts Implied in Fact
In a contract implied in fact, the conduct of the parties and the surrounding circumstances show mutual assent to the terms.

### Contracts Implied in Law
Contracts implied in law are recognized by the law on the basis of justice and equity, but may not include literal assent of both parties. Rather, on the basis of fairness, courts impose a contractual obligation where one does not otherwise exist. 

**Also known as**:
- "Unjust enrichment"
- "Quasi contract" 
- "Quantum meruit"

**Requirements for Implied in Law Contracts**:
1. A benefit has been conferred upon the defendant
2. The defendant appreciated the benefit
3. It would be inequitable or unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the value of the benefit

## Essential Elements of a Contract

A contract includes a promise, but it is more than a mere promise. For a legally enforceable contract, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Sufficiently definite promise** - Courts cannot enforce a promise that is overly ambiguous as to its terms
2. **Mutual assent**
3. **Consideration** 
4. **Legality**
5. **Capacity**

### Contract Performance and Breach

If a contract is formed, then both parties are supposed to perform their obligations. If a party fails to perform, that party is in **breach**. 

Proving breach frequently involves **interpretation of the contract**. To determine whether a party has not done what they were supposed to do, we first need to know what the contract said that they were supposed to do. Courts will apply an **objective perspective** to ascertain the intent of the parties.

---

# II. Requirements of a Contract

## A. Mutual Assent

### Definition
The first thing to look for to determine whether you have a contract is **"mutual assent."** Mutual assent indicates agreement between the parties to form the contract. Each party must voluntarily agree to the contract.

### Why Mutual Assent Matters
Because we believe that a party will only agree to a contract if she benefits from it, and if both parties to the contract are benefiting, therefore enforcement of the contract should be socially beneficial.

### Finding Mutual Assent: Offer and Acceptance

Mutual assent is normally found through identifying:
1. An **offer** (made by an offeror)
2. An **acceptance** of that offer (by the offeree)

#### Requirements for a Valid Offer

1. **Intent to be bound** by the offeror
   - Judged objectively: given the specific circumstances, would a reasonable person think that the offeror intended to be bound to the offer?

2. **Communication of the offer** to the offeree
   - The offer must be communicated to the offeree by the offeror (or by the offeror's authorized agent)
   - If an offeree performs the tasks requested by the offer without knowing that the offeror was requesting those tasks, then there is no mutual assent

3. **Definiteness of the offer**
   - The offer must be sufficiently definite that it is enforceable
   - A court must be able to determine whether a party is breaching a contract
   - The contract needs to be clear and definite enough so that the court can identify its specific terms

#### Requirements for Valid Acceptance

Acceptances have the same requirements as offers:
1. **Intent to be bound** to the offer (judged objectively)
2. The acceptance must be **communicated**
3. It must be **definite**

### Special Case: Advertisements

**Important aspect of intent**: How it applies to things like advertisements. An advertisement may be viewed by thousands of people. Is it possible that the business placing the advertisement would want to be contractually bound to each and every person that saw that advertisement? 

**Generally, no.** Consequently, most of the time, courts will find that things like advertisements lack sufficient intent to constitute an offer.

### Alternative: Meeting of the Minds

Another way of finding mutual assent is through what is known as **"the meeting of the minds."** 

- The idea here is that mutual agreement can be shown by proving that the two parties have an agreement about the same subject matter, under the same conditions
- If the two parties do not have the same conception over the content of the agreement, then there is no meeting of the minds and no contract
- This meeting of the minds is judged **objectively**

### Defenses to Mutual Assent

Even when mutual assent is proven, the defendant may still be able to assert a defense to mutual assent. These defenses include:
- Fraudulent and non-fraudulent misrepresentation
- Undue influence
- Mistake

---

## B. Consideration

### Definition
Another central requirement for a contract is that of **consideration**. Consideration is a somewhat abstract concept—something beyond agreement is needed to have a contract, and that something is consideration.

### Requirements for Consideration

For consideration to be found, there must be:

1. **Legal detriment** - Either someone is doing something they did not have to do, or they are forgoing something which they were entitled to

2. **Bargained for exchange** - That thing that they are doing or forgoing must be something that the other party had bargained for

### Example of Consideration

A common way to find consideration is if money is involved in the contract. Outside of the contract, a buyer would not be required to hand over $10 to the seller, and that $10 was the price that the seller had indicated for the good that the buyer would like to buy. The $10 then acts as consideration for the buyer.

**Important**: To be a valid contract, consideration by **both parties** must be found.

# Case Studies

## Case 1: Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School
*41 Ill. App. 3d 804, 354 N.E.2d 586 (1976)*

### Facts
- In December 1973, Robert Steinberg applied for admission to the Chicago Medical School as a first-year student for the academic year 1974–75 and paid an application fee of $15
- His application for admission was rejected
- Steinberg filed a class action against the school, claiming that it had failed to evaluate his application according to the academic entrance criteria printed in the school's bulletin
- Specifically, his complaint alleged that the school's decision was primarily based on nonacademic considerations such as:
  - Familial relationship to members of the school's faculty and board of trustees
  - The ability of the applicant or his family to pledge or make payment of large sums of money to the school

### The School's Published Criteria

The 1974–75 bulletin represented that the following criteria would be used:

> "Students are selected on the basis of scholarship, character, and motivation without regard to race, creed, or sex. The student's potential for the study and practice of medicine will be evaluated on the basis of academic achievement, Medical College Admission Test results, personal appraisals by a pre-professional advisory committee or individual instructors, and the personal interview, if requested by the Committee on Admissions."

### Legal Arguments

**Steinberg's Position**:
- The Chicago Medical School's informational brochure constituted an invitation to make an offer
- His subsequent application and submission of his $15 fee to the school amounted to an offer
- The school's voluntary reception of his fee constituted an acceptance
- Because of these events a contract was created between the school and himself
- The school was duty bound under the terms of the contract to evaluate his application according to its stated standards

**School's Position**:
- No contract came into being because informational brochures do not constitute offers
- They are construed by the courts to be general proposals to consider, examine and negotiate

### Court's Decision

**The court agreed with Steinberg's position**, finding:
- He and the school entered into an enforceable contract
- The school's obligation under the contract was stated in the school's bulletin in a definitive manner
- By accepting his application fee—a valuable consideration—the school bound itself to fulfill its promises
- Steinberg accepted the school's promises in good faith and was entitled to have his application judged according to the school's stated criteria

### Analysis Questions

1. **What did Chicago Medical School argue? Why was that a winning argument for the trial court?**

2. **Was there mutual assent here? What is needed for mutual assent and were all requirements met?**

3. **Was there consideration here? From Steinberg? From Chicago Medical School? If so, how was it met?**

4. **What were the terms of the contract? How can we find those? Is there something from mutual assent that would help us find those terms?**

## Case 2: Ennix v. Stanten
*556 F. Supp. 2d 1073 (N.D. Cal. 2008)*

### Background
This dispute arises out of a medical peer review where Dr. Coyness Ennix, Jr., an African-American cardiac surgeon, filed suit against defendants for racial discrimination. The essence of this case is that plaintiff was subjected to investigation and temporary loss of hospital privileges after he performed a new surgical procedure on four patients, one of whom died and three of whom suffered severe complications.

### The Facts

**Dr. Ennix's Background**:
- African-American cardiac surgeon
- Practiced in a five-person cardiac-surgery group at Summit Hospital in Oakland from 1981 to 1993
- In 1993, separated from the group and started an independent cardiac-surgery program at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley
- Later merged his practice to form the East Bay Cardiac Surgery Center Medical Group

**Hospital Relationship**:
- Dr. Ennix was a member of the ABSMC medical staff
- He performed services at ABSMC, paid annual membership fees to Summit Hospital, and agreed to abide by the Medical Staff bylaws
- ABSMC permitted him to practice medicine there
- ABSMC received payment of hospital fees relating to Dr. Ennix's treatment of patients

**The Incident**:
- In early 2004, Dr. Ennix began using a new, minimally invasive process ("MIV") to perform cardiac surgeries
- He performed four of these surgeries with problems including prolonged procedure time, increased blood usage, and conversion to the standard procedure
- One patient died; there were severe complications in the three other cases
- Hospital officials requested that Dr. Ennix cease performing MIV procedures

**The Review Process**:
- Dr. Steven Stanten asked Dr. Hon Lee to review the four MIV operations
- Dr. Lee concluded there were no quality-of-care concerns
- Despite this assessment, the committee decided not to accept Dr. Lee's conclusion
- After subsequent referrals, outside reviewers examined ten of Dr. Ennix's cases
- The report indicated three major problems: (i) poor judgment; (ii) poor technique; and (iii) substandard documentation
- As a result, Dr. Ennix's clinical privileges were summarily suspended

### Legal Issue: Was There a Contract?

**Why This Matters**: Dr. Ennix sued for racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which requires the existence of a contract.

**ABSMC's Argument**:
- There were no contracts between Dr. Ennix and ABSMC
- During deposition, Dr. Ennix stated he never had "any individual contract with Alta Bates Summit Medical Center"
- He had never been "an employee of the medical center"

**Dr. Ennix's Argument**:
- He had contractual relationships protected by Section 1981:
  1. His contractual relationship with ABSMC to perform services at the hospital
  2. His contractual relationships with patients to treat them

**Court's Analysis**:
Under California contract law, it is essential to the existence of a contract that there should be:
1. Parties capable of contracting
2. Their consent
3. A lawful object
4. A sufficient cause or consideration

**Court's Decision**:
- Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, a jury could reasonably conclude that there was a contract between ABSMC and Dr. Ennix
- There is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether or not there was a contractual relationship between the two
- This is enough to defeat ABSMC's motion for summary judgment

### Analysis Questions

1. **Is there mutual assent here? Can you find an offer, and if so by whom? Can you then find acceptance? Explain using specific facts from the case.**

2. **Is there consideration? Explain.**

3. **Should bylaws be enough to prove a contract? Why or why not? What about an employee handbook? If these do not constitute a contract on their own, what role could they play in contract law?**

---

## C. Other Requirements

In addition to mutual assent and consideration, there are a few additional requirements for a contract to be enforceable.

### Capacity
Each party must have sufficient legal capacity to enter into a contract. Examples of those lacking capacity:
- Someone who is unconscious
- Someone for whom the court has appointed a legal guardian, perhaps because that person does not have sufficient mental abilities to adequately protect themselves

### Legality
The subject matter of the contract must be legal. Examples:
- A gambling contract in a state where gambling is illegal is unenforceable by the courts
- Legality also extends to other types of contracts that courts may refuse to enforce on the grounds of public policy

#### Non-Compete Clauses

One such type of contract that courts frequently examine on the basis of legality is a contract with a **"non-compete clause."**

**What is a Non-Compete Clause?**
A non-compete clause says that, for a limited time, one party promises not to compete with the other party. It may prohibit:
- Starting a competing business
- Working for a competing business

**Court Approach**:
Courts are hesitant to enforce non-compete clauses because they reduce competition and limit labor mobility. However, under certain circumstances, courts (in states other than California and North Dakota) may choose to enforce a non-compete clause.

**Test for Enforceability**:
The primary test for determining whether to enforce a non-compete clause is to determine whether:

1. **There is a legitimate business interest** for the clause
   - Protection of confidential information
   - Maintenance of good will
   - Interest in an employee who has received special training at the expense of the company

2. **The clause has been narrowly tailored** to protect only that legitimate business interest
   - Must be narrowly tailored in terms of **time**, **geographic location**, and **business activity**
   - Clauses that are not adequately tailored may either be reformed by the court (re-drafted to the point that they are properly restricted) or struck down completely

### Statute of Frauds

Another requirement that is applicable to certain types of contracts is that, for these types of contracts, **the contract must be in writing** to be enforceable.

**Under the Statute of Frauds, the following contracts must be in writing**:
- Contracts for **real estate**
- **Goods over a certain dollar amount** ($500 or $5000)
- **Suretyships** (a promise to pay the debts of another, assuming secondary liability)
- **Long-term contracts** (something that, under its terms, cannot be completed within one year of the formation of the contract)

**Writing Requirements**:
For these types of contracts, the party wishing to enforce the contract must prove the existence at some time of a writing that:
- Contained the essential terms of the contract
- Contained the other party's signature

## Case Study: WellSpan Health v. Bayliss
*869 A.2d 990 (2005)*

### Background
This case involves the enforceability of a physician non-competition covenant and requirements for a permanent injunction.

### The Parties and Agreement

**WellSpan Health**:
- Not-for-profit healthcare system based in York, Pennsylvania
- Serves patients in south central Pennsylvania and northern Maryland
- Primary components: Gettysburg Hospital and York Hospital (a teaching hospital)

**Dr. Philip Bayliss**:
- Perinatologist (specialized medical practice focused on management of high risk pregnancies)
- Recruited by WellSpan to York Hospital in 1993
- Hired as Medical Director of the Perinatal/Genetic Program and Associate Residency Program Director for Obstetrics
- Later became Director of the Maternal Fetal Medicine Division and member of the Medical Executive Committee

**The Non-Compete Agreement**:
Shortly before starting work, Dr. Bayliss signed a professional services agreement that included a post-employment non-competition covenant. By the terms of the covenant, Dr. Bayliss agreed **not to engage in the practice of perinatology in York County or its four contiguous counties (Lancaster, Dauphin, Cumberland, and Adams) for two years after termination of his employment**.

### WellSpan's Investment in the Program

Under Dr. Bayliss, York Hospital's Maternal Fetal Medicine Division expanded to include:
- Two additional physicians (Kimberly Heller in 1994, Uma Reddy in 2002)
- New equipment (approximately $900,000 in capital equipment over five years)
- Additional personnel (technicians, genetics counselors, and nurses)
- Marketing strategies, including advertisements and a promotional videotape featuring Dr. Bayliss
- Referral linkages with physicians at Memorial Hospital, Hanover Hospital, and Gettysburg Hospital

### The Competitive Threat and Departure

**Lancaster General Hospital's New Facility**:
- In June 2001, Lancaster General Hospital opened a new Women and Babies Hospital (WBH) in Lancaster County, approximately 26 miles from WellSpan
- WellSpan recognized a competitive threat to its obstetrics practice, particularly in east York County

**Dr. Bayliss's Departure**:
- In February 2003, Dr. Bayliss announced his resignation from WellSpan, effective June 30, 2003
- He announced his intention to establish a maternal fetal medicine practice at WBH in Lancaster County, beginning July 1, 2003
- Several WellSpan staff members were recruited to Dr. Bayliss's new practice

### The Legal Proceedings

**WellSpan's Injunction Request**:
On June 17, 2003, WellSpan filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant.

**Trial Court's Decision**:
The trial judge:
- **Upheld the restrictive covenant** with regard to **York and Adams Counties**, forbidding Dr. Bayliss from engaging in the practice of perinatology in those counties until June 30, 2005
- **Refused to enforce the covenant** in **Lancaster, Dauphin, or Cumberland Counties**, based on his conclusion that WellSpan did not compete for perinatology patients in those counties
- Held that the covenant, as applied to geographical areas where WellSpan did not provide perinatology care, was unreasonable and hence unenforceable

### Legal Analysis

#### Pennsylvania Law on Non-Competition Covenants

Pennsylvania courts have historically been reluctant to enforce contracts that place restraints on trade or on the ability of an individual to earn a living; however, post-employment non-competition covenants are not per se unreasonable or unenforceable.

#### Requirements for Enforceability

**Threshold Requirement**: The covenant must be "reasonably related to the protection of a legitimate business interest."

**Recognized Legitimate Business Interests**:
1. **Trade secrets or confidential information**
2. **Unique or extraordinary skills**
3. **Customer good will**
4. **Investments in an employee specialized training program**

**What's NOT Protected**: A post-employment covenant that merely seeks to eliminate competition per se to give the employer an economic advantage is generally not enforceable.

#### Patient Referral Base as Protected Interest

The court recognized **patient referral base** as a legitimate, protectable interest, following the New Jersey case *Community Hospital Group v. More*:

**Rationale for Protection**:
- Without legal protection of their investments in young, subspecialty physicians, hospitals would be less likely to make the investments necessary to recruit such physicians
- The result would likely be a shortage of subspecialty physicians
- Referral bases of institutions providing highly specialized medical care could erode, causing serious harm to clinical care, physician training, and research programs

#### Balancing Test

If the threshold requirement of a protectable business interest is met, courts apply a balancing test:

1. **Employer vs. Employee**: The court balances the employer's protectable business interest against the employee's interest in earning a living
2. **Public Interest**: Both employer and employee interests are balanced against the interests of the public

**Reasonableness Analysis**:
- The covenant must be reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer
- The temporal and geographical restrictions imposed must be reasonably limited
- The determination of reasonableness is factual, requiring consideration of all circumstances

#### Special Considerations for Physicians

**Public Interest is Paramount**: The interests of the public are of paramount importance in the context of non-competition covenants for physicians.

**Close Judicial Scrutiny**: Courts undertake "close judicial scrutiny" of non-competition covenants involving physicians because of the value of their services to the public.

**Analysis Required**: The court must analyze whether enforcing the covenant would compromise patients' ability to obtain adequate skilled care in the geographical area.

### Court's Final Decision

**Regarding Lancaster County**:
- **Ample competent evidence** supported the court's conclusion that WellSpan and WBH were not competitors
- **Public interest strongly militates against enforcement**: Dr. Bayliss was the only perinatologist in Lancaster County
- The area was underserved in maternal fetal medicine
- The court properly "blue-lined" the covenant, refusing to enforce it in Lancaster County

**Regarding York and Adams Counties**:
- The restrictions were reasonably necessary for WellSpan's protection
- The court properly enforced the covenant in these counties

### Analysis Questions

1. **What legitimate business interests did WellSpan assert? Why did the court consider those interests legitimate? Explain.**

2. **How was the non-compete defined?**

3. **Was the non-compete reasonable in terms of time? Geography? Business activity?**

# III. Remedies

## What Happens If You Win a Contract Law Case?

What you get are called **remedies**. The remedies that the court can issue include **damages** and **injunctions**.

## Types of Damages

### Compensatory Damages

**Damages are payments of money**. There are different ways to calculate damages:

#### 1. Restitution
Return of money one side has already paid to the breaching side.

#### 2. Reliance
Compensation to the non-breaching side for reasonable expenses that side incurred after the contract was agreed to but prior to breach.

**Example**: After a singer agrees to perform a concert, the concert promoter would then need to spend money to rent a concert venue. That rent money could be compensable as reliance damages.

#### 3. Expectation
This is an estimate of the value of the contract to the non-breaching party if the contract had not been breached.

**Example**: If the contract price is $200 but the value of performance to the buyer is $350, then (if the contract price has not been paid) the breaching seller would owe the buyer $150 as expectation damages.

**Function**: All of these types of damages are known as compensatory damages, whose function it is to compensate the breached-upon party.

### Liquidated Damages

As you can probably tell, calculation of these damages is somewhat uncertain. As an alternative, contracting parties can stipulate the level of damages in the case of breach. These damages are known as **liquidated damages**.

**Court Approach**: Courts are somewhat hesitant to enforce liquidated damages, because they frequently will claim that they act as a penalty. This is unfortunate, because liquidated damages really operate as a mutually negotiated insurance policy, to cover the case of breach.

**Enforceability Requirements**: Courts may enforce liquidated damages if it can be shown that:
1. At the time of the formation of the contract, the amount of damages would be very uncertain
2. The amount of the liquidated damages would be a reasonable estimate of damages based on what is known at the time of contracting

### Other Types of Damages

#### Consequential Damages
Damages that arise when the breach of one contract affects the breached-upon party's ability to perform another contract.

#### Punitive Damages
A special type of damages imposed by the court when public policy suggests that additional disincentives beyond compensatory damages are needed to appropriately discourage certain behaviors, such as fraud.

## Injunctions

**An injunction is a court order** telling one side either that they must do something, or that they must not do something.

### Property Rules vs. Liability Rules

As noted by Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed, the difference between damages and injunctions is that:
- **Damages** reflect the protection of an entitlement by a **liability rule**
- **Injunctions** result from the protection of a **property rule**

**The Major Difference**: Who determines the "price" of the entitlement:
- **With an injunction**: A party wishing to escape the injunction must negotiate with the entitlement holder, and hence the parties would determine the "price" of the entitlement
- **With damages**: The court assesses the value of the entitlement

## Case Study: Anesthesia Med. Grp., P.C. v. Buras
*2006 WL 2737829 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2006)*

### Background
This case involves a claim for liquidated damages arising from the breach of a contract. The defendant resigned from his position with the plaintiff medical group, thereby triggering the provisions in the contract for repayment of an educational loan and of a sign-up bonus.

### The Agreement

**The Parties**:
- **Anesthesia Medical Group ("AMG")**: A practice group of anesthesiologists which employs certified registered nurse anesthetists ("CRNAs")
- **Paul Buras**: A registered nurse who wished to become a CRNA

**The Educational Program**:
Mr. Buras enrolled in the Middle Tennessee School of Anesthesia, which offers a twenty-seven month course of study to prepare students to take the boards and meet the other requirements for CRNA status.

**The Sponsorship Contract**:
Mr. Buras learned that AMG offered sponsorships to students enrolled in an accredited CRNA program. He was accepted and executed a contract on March 24, 1999, titled "LOAN AGREEMENT—CRNA EDUCATION PROGRAM."

### Contract Terms

**Basic Bargain**:
> Student intends to pursue a course of training to become a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) through a full time education program leading to such certification.
> 
> AMG is willing to assist in providing funds for tuition for Student's education, provided that Student agrees to work for AMG once Student has completed training and becomes a CRNA.

**Specific Terms**:
- **Loan**: Up to $22,500 for tuition assistance
- **Employment Obligation**: Work for AMG for three years at $85,000 per year, beginning within thirty days of certification
- **Loan Forgiveness**: If he successfully completed the three years of employment, repayment of the loans would be forgiven

### Default Provisions

**If Mr. Buras defaulted** by failing to complete the program, failing to pass certification, or failing to comply with any other provision:
- Repayment of the loans would be required, including interest
- Costs of collection (court costs and attorney fees) would be paid by Mr. Buras

**If he failed to fulfill the employment commitment** (constituting an "event of default"):
- **First 12 months**: $15,000 additional payment
- **Second 12 months**: $10,000 additional payment  
- **Third 12 months**: $5,000 additional payment

### Rationale for Liquidated Damages

The contract explained the rationale:

> Student and AMG through their execution of this agreement hereby acknowledge that AMG has invested substantial time and monies in the development and training of Student and that Student's termination would detrimentally affect the operations of AMG. Student and AMG further agree that the harm to AMG would be difficult, if not impossible, to quantify and that the above amounts are reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances and fairly represent that loss which would be suffered by AMG.

### Sign-On Bonus Agreement

As Mr. Buras approached completion of his studies, AMG offered him a $10,000 sign-on bonus ($5,000 immediately, $5,000 closer to graduation) representing his "intention to remain employed by AMG for a minimum period of two years."

**Repayment Schedule for Early Termination**:
- **Within first 12 months**: Full $10,000 payable
- **Within second 12 months**: $5,000 payable

### Mr. Buras's Performance and Resignation

**Performance**:
- Mr. Buras began working for AMG on November 7, 2001
- He graduated, passed his certification examination, and began working at Baptist Hospital

**Resignation**:
- He decided that working for AMG was not a good fit because the attending anesthesiologists did not allow him to exercise his independent clinical judgment
- On July 18, 2002, he sent a brief resignation letter, giving one month notice that his last day would be August 16, 2002

### Trial Court Proceedings

**AMG's Lawsuit**: Filed to collect money owed under the contract.

**Trial Court's Decision**:
- Granted AMG partial summary judgment
- Ordered Mr. Buras to repay the loan, the sign-on bonus, and attorney fees and costs
- **Denied the liquidated damages**, reasoning that those damages were punitive in nature and were an unenforceable penalty

### Evidence of Actual Damages

**AMG's Testimony** (through Diana Bird and Tammy Myers):
- It was very difficult to find and retain enough CRNAs to fully staff an anesthesia practice
- The sponsorship program was designed to help AMG secure needed CRNAs
- When a CRNA defaulted, AMG typically incurred expenses including payment of a locum tenens until a permanent replacement could be found and/or agency fees

**Specific Costs for Replacing Mr. Buras**:
- **Locum tenens costs**: $95-$105 per hour, plus $10 per hour charge to agency, plus $25 per day to locum tenens, plus travel/meal/lodging expenses
- **Duration**: Three different locum tenens for fourteen weeks before finding permanent replacement
- **Total cost**: Over $62,000 to locum tenens vs. approximately $30,000 Mr. Buras would have been paid
- **Net additional cost**: Approximately $32,000
- **Potential finder's fee**: $12,000 if permanent replacement came through agency

### Appellate Court's Analysis

#### Contract Construction Principles

**Central Tenet**: The intent of the contracting parties at the time of executing the agreement should govern.

**Court's Role**: Ascertain the intention of the parties based upon the usual, natural, and ordinary meaning of the language used.

**Clear Language**: Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, its literal meaning controls the outcome.

#### Liquidated Damages Law

**Tennessee's Approach**: The court adopted the "prospective approach" which focuses on the circumstances at the time of contract formation, rather than actual damages at the time of breach.

**Requirements for Valid Liquidated Damages**:
1. The amount must bear a **reasonable relationship** to the amount of actual damages that would likely be sustained
2. The actual amount of damages would be **difficult to determine or prove**
3. Both requirements judged **as of the time of contract formation**

**Policy Rationale**: Parties choose the certainty and efficiency provided by liquidated damages over the uncertainty and burden of requiring the non-breaching party to prove actual damages.

#### Application to This Case

**Foreseeability of Damages**: At the time the contract was signed, it was clearly foreseeable that AMG would suffer damages if Mr. Buras did not complete his three-year employment commitment.

**Known Elements of Likely Damages**:
- Costs of acquiring locum tenens services (substantially higher than salaried CRNA)
- Potential agency fees for permanent replacement
- Administrative time and effort for finding replacements

**Difficulty in Predicting Actual Amount**: The actual amount of damages could not be accurately predicted because it could not be ascertained:
- How long it would take to find a permanent replacement
- The actual salary differential at time of resignation
- The prevailing costs of locum tenens at that time
- The exact amount of any agency fees
- Any salary increase needed for permanent replacement

**Reasonableness of $15,000**: 
- The figure was a reasonable prediction based on identifiable and reasonable factors
- It was not disproportionate in AMG's favor
- In fact, it was favorable to the student compared to actual damages of approximately $32,000

### Court's Decision

**The appellate court reversed the trial court** and awarded AMG the $15,000 in liquidated damages.

**Reasoning**: 
- The liquidated damages provision was enforceable
- Enforcement gives effect to the original intentions of the parties
- It furthers the goals and purposes of stipulating in advance to potential damages

### Analysis Questions

1. **What was the original agreement?**

2. **Why did AMG want the liquidated damages clause?**

3. **Does the liquidated damages clause help the parties better understand each other's positions, i.e. would Buras have contemplated AMG's other expenses without this clause?**

4. **Why might that be important for contract law?**

5. **How did the court determine the parties' intentions? Explain using specific facts.**

6. **Was this liquidated damages clause enforceable? Explain.**

# The Rest of the Story... River Park Hospital v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee

As discussed in the beginning of this chapter, contracts can be **express**, **implied in fact**, or **implied in law**.

## The Court's Analysis

### No Express or Implied-in-Fact Contract

In the case of River Park Hospital v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee:
- The parties had done business for six years pursuant to terms in an express agreement
- That deal expired on December 31, 1999 and negotiations to extend the contract were not successful
- Given the failure to negotiate a new express agreement and the fact that emergency room patients are required by federal law to be treated, the court did not find either express or implied assent on the part of BlueCare to pay River Park's standard rates
- **Without mutual assent between the parties, there cannot be a finding of legally enforceable, contractual obligation**

### Contract Implied in Law (Unjust Enrichment)

However, the law does recognize an equitable obligation rooted in **justice, fairness, and sense of what is right**. These obligations are referred to as **contracts implied in law** or **unjust enrichment**.

**The Court's Finding**: The court found that BlueCross had been unjustly enriched by River Park's provision of services to BlueCare enrollees—services which River Park was required to provide pursuant to federal EMTALA law.

### The Unique Circumstances

**Neither party had any choice but to deal with one another**:

1. **River Park's Obligations**: When presented with an emergency patient, EMTALA mandated that River Park treat the patient—regardless of whether the patient is an enrollee of BlueCare

2. **BlueCare's Obligations**: Pursuant to its contractual obligations with the State of Tennessee, BlueCare was required to pay for emergency medical services provided to its enrollees, regardless of whether the enrollee was treated by an in-network or out-of-network provider

### Court's Conclusion

In this interesting situation created by:
- River Park's duties under federal law, and 
- BlueCare's obligations under its contract with the State of Tennessee

These two private parties were left with **no choice but to deal with each other** in the context of emergency patients.

**Legal Analysis**: The court noted that there was no assent or meeting of the minds necessary under traditional contract analysis, but **"reason and justice"** dictated recognition of a contract implied in law, i.e., unjust enrichment.

### Practical Implications

**Legal Victory**: Having made this threshold determination, River Park's lawsuit against BlueCare was permitted to continue, but subsequent legal proceedings would ultimately determine whether BlueCare would be required to pay River Park's full standard rates or a rate closer to what BlueCare had already reimbursed.

**Practical Effects**: This preliminary legal victory for River Park would also provide:
- Leverage for a negotiated settlement
- Incentive for both parties to re-open contract discussions, at least with regard to fees involving emergency patients
