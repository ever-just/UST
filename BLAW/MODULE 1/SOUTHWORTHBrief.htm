<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>SOUTHWORTH v. OLIVER</b>
(1978)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Facts &amp; Procedure</b>:
Defendant Oliver decided to sell some of his ranch property in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>. He talked to
Plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Southworth</span> who said he wanted to buy the
property. Oliver agreed to determine the price for the property and to let <span
class=SpellE>Southworth</span> know &quot;what he wanted for the land.&quot; <span
class=SpellE>Southworth</span> also later telephoned Oliver to &quot;ask him if
his plans for selling continued to be in force, and he said 'yes'.&quot;
Several days later <span class=SpellE>Southworth</span> received from Oliver a
letter dated June 17, 1976, stating as follows: “Enclosed please find the
information about the ranch sales that I had discussed with you
previously…These prices are the market value according to the records of the
Grant County Assessor…” The enclosure with the letter stated “Selling
approximately 2933 Acres in <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Grant</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceName> in T. 16 S., R. 31 E., W. M. near <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Seneca</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Oregon</st1:State></st1:place>
at the assessed market value of…$ 324,419.” Upon receiving the letter, <span
class=SpellE>Southworth</span> immediately responded by letter to Oliver,
stating: “I accept your offer.&quot; Oliver refused to sell claiming the June
17 letter was not an offer, just a price quotation. The trial court held that
Oliver was making an offer to sell the property, and that plaintiff had
accepted the offer. The court granted specific performance requiring the
defendants (Oliver and his wife) to sell the land to <span class=SpellE>Southworth</span>.
Oliver appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Issue</b>: Was
Defendants' letter of June 17, 1976, an &quot;offer&quot; to sell the ranch
lands?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Decision</b>: Yes.
Trial court decree affirmed. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Reasoning</b>: In
order to have a contract, you need an offer and an acceptance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are some cases where the stating of a
particular price may be seen as simply a “price quotation,” i.e. the starting
point for future negotiations, and not an offer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other cases, the stating of a particular
price may be seen as an offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In distinguishing
between the former and the latter, we need to consider the particular
circumstances would lead a “reasonable person” to believe that the stating of a
price meant that someone is making an offer to sell. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, it seems that Oliver's letter to <span
class=SpellE>Southworth</span> was an offer to sell the ranch lands. That
letter did not come to plaintiff &quot;out of the blue,&quot; as in some of the
cases involving advertisements or price quotations. Neither was this a price
quotation resulting from an inquiry by plaintiff. Defendants decided to sell
the lands in question and defendant Joseph Oliver then sought out the plaintiff
who owned adjacent lands. Defendant Oliver told plaintiff that defendants were
interested in selling that land, inquired whether plaintiff was interested, and
was told by plaintiff that he was &quot;very interested in the land,&quot; after
which they discussed the particular lands to be sold. That conversation was
terminated with the understanding that Mr. Oliver would &quot;determine&quot;
the value and price of that land, i.e., &quot;what he wanted for the
land,&quot; and that plaintiff would undertake to arrange financing for the
purchase of that land. Under these facts and circumstances, when plaintiff
received the letter of June 17th, with enclosures, which stated a price of
$324,419 for the 2,933 acres in T 16 S, R 31 E., W.M., as previously identified
by the parties with reference to a map, and stating &quot;terms&quot; of 29
percent down balance over five years at eight percent interest with a
&quot;sale date&quot; of either December 1, 1976, or January 1, 1977, a
reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have believed that
defendants were making an offer to sell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The failure to add the word &quot;offer&quot; and the use of the word
&quot;information&quot; are also not controlling. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Managerial
Implications</b>: Whether an offer for a contract has been made is determined
by the words and conduct of the parties, and what a reasonable person would
believe those words and conduct to mean under the surrounding circumstances.
The word offer is not required, not is it important whether one subjectively
intends to enter into a contract. Business persons need to be careful in the
negotiating process to make sure that the language they use and their actions
are clear regarding their contractual intentions.</p>
