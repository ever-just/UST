Hi. Welcome to a briefing in case and legal analysis by IRAC. Okay, so we're going to go through how to brief a case. This is helpful as you take a look at cases. This is one way of doing it. It's not the only way, but kind of early on. It might be a good way to give you a better sense of what's going on in the case. But also we'll be going through IRAC, which is kind of the legal structure of how to do legal analysis. So that's a good thing for you to learn.

When it comes to time to do the final exam and the mid course exercise, you should be using the IRAC method. 

### Basic Format for Briefing Cases

Okay, so here's your basic format for briefing cases. You can start off with the **case name** and then get into the **facts**. The **issues**, the **decision**, **reasons**, and then finally **managerial implications**. 

So the facts include things, you know, what happened in the case, but also it can include kind of what happened procedurally. How did the case get here? The issue. That's the legal question that the court's trying to resolve. The decision is how did the court decide that? So when you're doing your legal analysis, the issue is kind of your starting point and the decision is a possible ending point. 

When it comes to doing the reasoning part, this is your own rationale. So you don't have to come to the same conclusion as a court. It's your rationale for deciding the case. Now when you do that, you're going to do the rule, analysis, and leading on to conclusion. 

Okay, now one thing that's helpful in doing, looking at cases is sometimes think about managerial implications. What are the significance of this particular case to business? We're going to be doing that a little bit differently in our course. We're going to be working on kind of policies and all after looking at cases. But anyway, that's a good thing to do sometimes.

### Example: Caldwell v. Bechtel Case Brief

Okay, so how do you do it? Do a brief. So I've had you, I've also upon Blackboard. I've also posted this one case called **Caldwell versus Bechtel**. It's a case from DC from 1980. And it's a pretty good one for just introducing the basic briefing analysis. So hopefully you've taken a look at that, and now we're going to get into how we would brief this case. 

#### Case Name
So start off with the case name. So it's called **Caldwell versus Bechtel**. Now one thing to note in many cases, the case name is going to give you some information. Much of the time Caldwell, the first person listed is normally going to be the plaintiff, and the second person is going to be the defendant. But that's not always the case. We may also have appellant and appellee. But anyway, that's the name gives you a little information.

Now when you write things down, you should write down the case name there. And then I think it's helpful to write down the year that the case came from. Now you'll notice there's some other numbers and letters and stuff here. These are very useful for lawyers. What these are our specific places to find these cases. So all the cases end up in some reporter or another one actually, not all of them. But most of the cases end up in some reporter, and you have to be able to find, well, where do they actually show up? Well, this one came from the federal reporter, and it's the second one, and it's volume 631 on page 989. So it's particular place to find this. That's one way of doing that.

#### Facts
Okay. So what happened in the case? So what's going on exactly? So here we go. So who are the parties?

Well, we've got **Caldwell**, who's a construction worker, who'd been mucking around in these tunnels. And there's a lot of **silica dust** in these tunnels, and he contracts **silicosis**. Now, meanwhile, the other side, **Bechtel** - they're a consultant engineering firm.

Well, who has a contract? Well, **the metro and Bechtel** do, but **Caldwell and Bechtel do not**. So how do this case end up here? Well, this case ended up here because the trial court granted **summary judgment** to Bechtel on the basis that they didn't owe a duty to Caldwell.

So basically what happened at the trial court was the trial court said, okay. Bechtel, you're saying there's no contract with you and Caldwell. Well, if there's no contract, there's no duty. Well, is that right? Well, that's why Caldwell appeals.

So we've got the case name and the facts. Let's go down to the next part.

#### Issue
So what's the issue? Well, here, much of the time you can't, you have to kind of look around and think about it a little bit, but this court actually starts off and telling you the basic issue. It says specifically the first paragraph.

**The basic issue is whether a consultant engineering firm owed the worker a duty to protect against unreasonable risk of harm.**

Okay, bam, there you go.

#### Decision 
Okay, so how do this court decide? Okay, court decided that **Bechtel did owe Caldwell a duty of due care** to protect him against the foreseeable risk to his health posed by excessive concentration of silica dust.

Okay, so again, this is the issue that's the start of your analysis and the decision is a possible end. It doesn't have to be your end, but that's one possible end. By doing that, sometimes that helps you try to figure out what goes on in the middle.

#### Reasons (Using IRAC Method)

Okay, so the reasons. Okay, so again, the reason is going to be the hard part. And again, this is your reasoning. So you have to try to step back a little bit and think, you know, how do I explain how the court, how I court, if you were the judge, how you would decide.

So just remember, again, we're going to follow the **IRAC structure**. We've already done the **Issue** and now we're going to look at the **Rules**. We've gone to the **Analysis** or our application of facts and then end up with our **Conclusion**.

##### Rules
Okay, so rules. So can we find a legal rule here? Well, this is a **tort case**. This is an injury. And in tort, most of the time we use what's called the **negligence approach**. And so for negligence, we have to show **duty, breach, causation, and damages**.

Now, important thing, again, if you, those are the four requirements to prove negligence. **If you fail to prove any one of those four, the case is over.** And so if there's no duty, there's no case. And so again, that's why summary judgment was granted by the trial court.

So let's think about **duty**. So can we find a rule about duty? Well, if you look down a few paragraphs down into the case, the court actually starts talking about duty. What's it say? It says, well, secondary, but equally important principle involved is the determination of **to whom the duty is owed**.

So to whom is the duty owed? Well, it answers that. The court answers that by saying a **foreseeable plaintiff**. Well, what's a foreseeable plaintiff? **A foreseeable plaintiff is somebody who might be foreseeably injured by the defendant's conduct.**

All right, so now we've got a rule.

##### Analysis/Application
You know, we've got a rule now we're going to go into our analysis and try to apply the facts. So let's look at this, try to think about, okay, so what conduct is talking about injured by defendant's conduct. So what conduct? How are the facts going to come into play here?

All right, so this is where it starts getting a little tricky here. **I call it the art of legal reasoning.** How do you actually start constructing an argument? How do you use the rules with the facts? Again, it's not always clear, but kind of the more practice you get, the better you get, better you'll become in terms of doing the art of legal reasoning.

Okay, so what do you think? So how should we use the rule with those facts? Okay, so you're asking about, okay, so **who might be foreseeably harmed by defendant's conduct?**

Okay, so what conduct does Bechtel do? Well, they should be responsible for **checking for dangerous conditions**. Okay, they're consulting engineering, you know, they should do that. So if they fail to do that, who might be harmed if they don't do their job?

So if their conduct is to check for these things. Another type of conduct would be **failing to do that**. And that's kind of twisting that a little bit, but that's, again, one of those tricks in doing legal analysis, kind of taking one point and then twisting it the other way.

So who might be harmed if Bechtel fails to check for dangerous conditions? Well, the **workers** might be affected, but anybody else? Well, maybe the **general public, riders on Metro**.

So, okay, so those are the different people that can be affected. So who was Caldwell? A **worker in the tunnel**. So, how do we put those things together now?

Well, again, as you recall, again, now we're going to use that rule. **So if Bechtel failed to do its job, then a worker in the tunnel might be foreseeably harmed. And so, Caldwell, the worker in the tunnel is a foreseeable plaintiff.**

Okay, so now what we're doing here is we're using the definition of foreseeable plaintiff that we defined before. We're taking that and applying that to the facts and coming up with a conclusion about Caldwell being a foreseeable plaintiff.

##### Conclusion
Well, does that fully get us to the end? Not quite yet. Because now we've got to go back to the rule. The rule says **to whom is the duty owed? A foreseeable plaintiff.** Now we connect back to that rule and we get our final conclusion, which is that **Bechtel did owe Caldwell a duty of due care**.

So that's your conclusion. Okay, so one thing that's important to notice is that **the conclusion has an answer to the question that was asked by the issue.** Okay, that's how you know you're at the end.

### Business Implications

Okay, so real briefly what about some business implications? Well, think about it. So the way the case initially went was Bechtel is like, okay, we don't have a contract with Caldwell, so we don't owe them a duty.

All right, now this case is saying **no** because Caldwell may be a foreseeable plaintiff. He may be foreseeably harmed if they don't do their job. Then Caldwell is a foreseeable plaintiff and they owe them a duty.

Now **who else does Bechtel owe a duty?** Well, if you remember back before, we're talking about the general public, all the different people might be riding.

So whereas before this case, Bechtel may have been thinking well, they only owe duties to people they have contracts with. **After this case, it's pretty clear that no Bechtel owes duties to absolutely everybody who may be affected by too much silica dust in those metro tunnels.**

Now that should scare Bechtel a little bit. **That's much more liability than they may have initially thought.**

### Summary

All right, last thing I just want you to take again, this was an example of using **IRAC**. Okay, so this is how we do legal reasoning, IRAC. So again, it's **Issue, Rule, Analysis or Application and then Conclusion**.

**That's the structure you should be using and we'll get lots of chances and you'll be really good at legal reasoning.**

Okay, thanks.
