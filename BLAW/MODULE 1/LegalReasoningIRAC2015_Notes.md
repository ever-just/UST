## IRAC Method Overview

**IRAC** stands for:
- **I**ssue - The legal question the court is trying to resolve
- **R**ule - The applicable legal principle or law  
- **A**pplication/Analysis - Applying the rule to the facts ("The art of legal reasoning")
- **C**onclusion - Answer to the issue (must answer the original question)

**Key Point:** Use IRAC structure for final exam and mid-course exercise!

## Caldwell v. Bechtel Case Analysis

### Facts
- **Caldwell:** Construction worker working in metro tunnels
- **Bechtel:** Consultant engineering firm hired by Metro
- **Problem:** Caldwell contracted silicosis from silica dust in tunnels
- **Contracts:** Metro-Bechtel contract exists, but NO Caldwell-Bechtel contract
- **Procedural:** Trial court granted summary judgment to Bechtel (no duty = no case)

### Issue
**"Whether a consultant engineering firm owed the worker a duty to protect against unreasonable risk of harm"**

### Decision
**Court ruled Bechtel DID owe Caldwell a duty of due care** to protect against foreseeable health risks from silica dust.

### IRAC Analysis

#### Rules
1. **Tort Case:** This is a negligence case
2. **Negligence Elements:** Must prove ALL four:
   - **Duty**
   - **Breach** 
   - **Causation**
   - **Damages**
   
   ⚠️ **Critical:** If you fail to prove ANY ONE element, case is over!

3. **Duty Rule:** "To whom is duty owed? **A foreseeable plaintiff**"
   - **Foreseeable Plaintiff:** Someone who might foreseeably be injured by defendant's conduct

#### Analysis/Application ("The Art of Legal Reasoning")
- **Bechtel's Conduct:** Responsible for checking dangerous conditions
- **Failed Conduct:** NOT checking for dangerous conditions  
- **Who might be harmed?** 
  - Workers in tunnels
  - General public/Metro riders
- **Caldwell's Status:** Worker in tunnel
- **Application:** If Bechtel fails to check → worker might be foreseeably harmed → Caldwell = foreseeable plaintiff

#### Conclusion
- **Rule:** Duty owed to foreseeable plaintiff
- **Application:** Caldwell is foreseeable plaintiff  
- **Conclusion:** **Bechtel owed Caldwell duty of due care**

✅ **Check:** Conclusion answers the original issue = You're done!

## Business Implications

**Before this case:** Bechtel thought they only owed duties to people with contracts

**After this case:** Bechtel owes duties to EVERYONE who may be affected by their work
- Workers
- General public
- Metro riders
- Anyone foreseeably harmed

**Result:** **Much more liability** than initially expected - "should scare Bechtel"

## Key Learning Points

### IRAC Tips
1. **Issue:** Start your analysis here
2. **Rule:** Find the legal principle 
3. **Analysis:** "The art of legal reasoning" - practice makes better
4. **Conclusion:** Must answer the issue question

### Legal Reasoning Tricks
- **"Twisting":** Take one point and twist it the other way
- **Example:** Conduct = checking for dangers → Twisted = FAILING to check for dangers
- More practice = better at legal reasoning

### Negligence Strategy
- **Remember the 4 elements:** Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages
- **Focus on duty first:** No duty = no case
- **Foreseeable plaintiff test:** Key for determining duty
