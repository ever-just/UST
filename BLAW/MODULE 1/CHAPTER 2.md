# Chapter 2: Ethics and Professionalism in Healthcare

## Introduction

This opening case is designed for individual reflection and group discussion.

### Dr. Grey Stimson's Career Decision

Dr. Grey Stimson knew since he was young that he wanted to be an urologist. The first person in his family to finish college, he wasn't sure what had sparked this particular interest in urinary systems and male reproductive medicine. But after seven years of post-medical school residencies and sub-specialty fellowships, Grey knew one thing—he was excited to join a urology practice, launch his career, and begin whittling away at his approximately **$200,000 in student loan debt**.

With his advanced training and winning personality, Grey interviews very successfully with both of the leading urology practices in his midsized town of Brightfield:
- **Brightfield Urology Specialists (BUS)**
- **Urology Associates of Brightfield (UAB)**

He receives offers to join both practices. They are similar in many respects, including their treatment of roughly the same number of prostate cancer patients.

## Understanding Prostate Cancer

### Statistical Overview

**Prostate cancer** is a significant health concern globally:
- **Second most common form of cancer** worldwide
- Approximately **241,000 men** in the United States receive a new diagnosis every year
- Deaths are approximately **28,000** annually
- For most men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the disease is **clinically localized and slow-growing**

### Survival Rates
- **5-year survival rate**: 99%
- **10-year survival rate**: 98%
- Most men do not end up dying from the disease

### Risk Factors
1. **Advanced age**
2. **Race and ethnicity** (highest incidence in African Americans)
3. **Family history**

### Symptoms
- In early stages, prostate cancer typically **does not have symptoms**
- As the cancer grows, it may cause:
  - Inability to urinate or frequent urination
  - Pain or burning during urination
  - Blood in the urine

## Treatment Options for Prostate Cancer

### 1. Active Surveillance
**Description**: Office visit monitoring approach
- **Frequency**: Every 6 months
- **Includes**: 
  - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing
  - Digital rectal examination
  - Prostate biopsy
- **Average Cost**: $4,228

### 2. Radical Prostatectomy
**Description**: Complete removal of the prostate gland with a surgical procedure
- **Cost varies** depending on the surgical approach
- **Average Cost**: $16,762

### 3. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)
**Description**: Computer-driven machine that revolves around the patient as it delivers beams of radiation aimed at the prostate from multiple angles
- **Features**:
  - Radiation intensity can be adjusted to target cancerous tissue
  - Limits exposure to healthy tissue
- **Average Cost**: $31,574
- **Important Note**: Because urologists are not trained in radiation oncology, IMRT must be managed by a **radiation oncologist**

#### IMRT Provider Options
Radiation oncologists can be:
1. **Employed by the urology practice**
2. **Employed at a hospital**
3. **Working at an independent radiation center** not affiliated with the urology practice

**Self-Referral Definition**: When an urologist refers a patient to a radiation oncologist employed by her urology practice, such an act is known as **self-referral**.

### Clinical Evidence
According to clinical studies, **no single treatment approach is preferable** with respect to:
- Risk of adverse events
- Impact on a patient's quality of life

---

## Patient Decision-Making Process

### Factors Patients Consider

According to Jean Mitchell, an economist and professor of public policy at Georgetown University, when selecting a treatment option, the patient will consider:

1. **Recommendations of physicians**
2. **Tumor attributes**
3. **Whether monitoring is preferable to definitive treatment**
4. **Costs of and time required for treatment**
5. **Potential side effects**:
   - Urinary dysfunction
   - Bowel dysfunction  
   - Sexual dysfunction
6. **Individual characteristics**:
   - Age
   - Race or ethnic group
   - Highest educational level attained

### The Challenge
Such a decision can be **overwhelming for patients** who don't have clinical expertise or medical training. Thus, **the physician's recommendation has significant influence** over how a patient decides to proceed after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.

## The Two Practice Options

As Grey is weighing his options between BUS and UAB, he is troubled by **one significant difference** in the two practices, and it's causing him to wrestle hard with the decision about which practice to join.

### Brightfield Urology Specialists (BUS)

#### The Investment Decision
Two years ago BUS made a significant investment:
- **Hired an in-house radiation oncologist** to develop and monitor IMRT for prostate cancer patients
- **Hired support staff**
- **Invested $2 million in capital start-up costs** to acquire the equipment needed

#### BUS's Claims
BUS urologists claim they are now able to **integrate IMRT into their practice more seamlessly**, which they argue:
- Reduces the risk of adverse events
- Improves outcomes for patients

#### The Reality Check
Grey knows the literature, however, and **evidence from clinical studies indicates** that each of the primary treatment options for prostate cancer has its pros and cons in terms of:
- Patient side effects
- Impact on quality of life

#### Financial Impact
The impact on the **BUS bottom line is less ambiguous**:

**Market Research**: When BUS was weighing the financial costs and benefits, it was informed by **Urorad Healthcare** (a company that markets complete packages of IMRT technology and services to urologists) that:
- Treating an average of **18 new patients each month** would result in more than **$425,000 in additional revenue per urologist annually**

**Results**: As predicted, the decision to bring IMRT in-house as an investment of the urology practice group has resulted in IMRT revenues over the last two years that have **significantly increased the income** for members of the BUS group.

### Urology Associates of Brightfield (UAB)

#### UAB's Approach
The UAB practice **does not self-refer** to an in-house radiation oncologist for IMRT therapies. Rather, UAB urologists refer prostate cancer patients to either:
- **Hospital-based radiation centers**
- **Independent radiation centers**

#### UAB's Rationale

**1. Clinical Evidence**:
- The UAB practice points to literature confirming that **all mainstream treatment options yield similar outcomes**

**2. Ethical Concerns**:
- The UAB urologists worry about the **inherent conflict of interest** that flows from self-referral schemes
- UAB cites studies indicating that **self-referring urology practice groups** (such as BUS) are **much more likely to refer patients towards IMRT** when less expensive and potentially better-suited options are available

**3. Legal Concerns**:
- UAB notes that generally **self-referral schemes are illegal under U.S. federal laws**
- It is only because of a **loophole** that IMRT and other radiation therapies can be owned and integrated into a urologist practice

#### UAB's Commitment
UAB explains to Grey that urologists in the practice will continue to refer patients, **when appropriate**, to radiation oncologists working at either hospital-based or independent radiation centers.

#### UAB's Philosophy
In the opinion of UAB:
- The research linking **increased use of services and escalating health care spending**—with **no clear benefit to patients**—is just too overwhelming
- UAB fears that the **professional judgment of its urologists will be compromised** by the opportunity to reap considerable, additional amounts of profit

## Discussion Questions

1. **Is there an ethical decision to be made, or is this merely a business decision that Grey must make?** After all, as indicated, the in-house (or self-referral) ability to offer IMRT is not a violation of any law or regulation. How would you describe and frame the dilemma and what difference does the law make in your analysis?

2. **Who are the stakeholders, i.e., who will be impacted by Grey's decision?**

3. **What facts are most important in conducting your analysis?** What information do you wish you had that would help clarify or resolve this dilemma?

4. **If you were in Grey's shoes, which practice group would you join and why?**

## The Intersection of Law, Business, Medicine, and Ethics

The legal and financial aspects of medicine inevitably give rise to questions of ethics and professionalism. This chapter focuses on these questions of ethics and professionalism and provides a foundation and framework that will be used throughout this book.

As scholars at Washington University and St. Louis University have recently observed, **physicians wrestle frequently with decisions at the intersection of business, medicine, law, and ethics**.

### Most Important Ethical Dilemmas in Healthcare
