# Chapter 4: Torts and Medical Malpractice

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- **EXPLAIN THE REQUIREMENTS TO PROVE A TORT BY NEGLIGENCE, KNOWN IN HEALTH CARE AS MEDICAL MALPRACTICE**
- **DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO PROOF OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE**
- **DEVELOP BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS RELATED TO MEDICAL MALPRACTICE**

## Introduction

This case is presented for individual reflection and group discussion.

Sam Cleveland entered a hospital emergency department (ED), presenting with flu-like symptoms. A triage nurse examined Sam, took his medical history, and categorized him as a low priority patient due to the mild nature of his affliction. During this initial intake, Sam did not relay all of his medical history, such as the fact that he had diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, as well as other chronic conditions. Nor did he disclose the fact that he was currently taking medication.

Eventually, a physician assistant named George Eubanks saw Sam. After an examination, George concluded Sam did not need a chest x-ray or any additional tests. He diagnosed Sam with an upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, and sinusitis, which resulted in prescriptions for a variety of medications. George never consulted a physician, nor did he consult Sam's medical file, which contained his full history, including prior congestive heart failure. Sam was discharged with prescriptions in hand.

A short time after Sam was released, George came across Sam's medical history. There he discovered that Sam had many chronic conditions. However, after reviewing the file, George did not believe there was anything in the file necessitating Sam's return back to the ED right away for follow-up treatment.

Two days later Sam returned to the ED where he was diagnosed with pneumonia resulting from congestive heart failure. Eventually, he went into respiratory and cardiac arrest, slipped into a coma, and remained in such comatose state until his death several years later.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Did George do anything wrong pursuant to the medical standard of care for a physician assistant?**

2. **Is George legally responsible for Sam's death? How does a court resolve questions of legal liability?**

3. **Did George do anything wrong ethically? What ethical responsibilities did George owe to Sam?**

# I. What Is a Tort? What Is Medical Malpractice?

What some might call an "accident," a court may determine is a "tort." A tort is a wrong committed upon someone, causing them some harm. In health care, the most-discussed tort is that of medical malpractice, which is handled under the legal doctrine of negligence. In addition to medical malpractice, physicians and health care organizations should be aware of torts handled under strict liability—such as for a defective medical product—and intentional torts such as battery and false imprisonment. In this chapter, we examine in depth negligence in the health care context, and then examine these other torts along with defenses to torts.

# II. Negligence

When a speeding car strikes a pedestrian, the liability of the driver is determined by applying negligence. When a customer slips on a broken jar in a grocery aisle, the liability of the grocery store is determined by applying negligence. And when a patient is harmed when a physician does not follow customary treatment guidelines, the liability of the physician is determined by applying negligence. So how do we apply negligence to determine the liability of these different possible "tortfeasors?"

We will see that under the law, injury on its own is insufficient to prove negligence. What the plaintiff must show is that the defendant is fundamentally responsible for her injury. In common law, proving negligence requires proof of four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages.

## Proof of Negligence

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Duty** | The defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the victim |
| **Breach** | This duty was breached |
| **Causation** | This breach caused the injured party to suffer damages |
| **Damages** | The plaintiff suffered actual harm |

A plaintiff must show that the possible tortfeasor owed a duty of reasonable care to the victim; that this duty was breached; and that this breach caused the injured party to suffer damages. By imposing liability on a tortfeasor, the negligence system provides strong incentives for individuals to take reasonable care and thereby prospectively prevent many accidents. It is important to note though that the goal here is not to prevent all accidents, but instead to prevent those for which it is reasonable to do so. Negligence also serves an equitable purpose, by imposing the costs of careless behavior on those people who could have taken better care, rather than those who are injured by their lack-of-care.

In the health care setting, interpretation of these requirements has evolved, as courts apply them to the specific setting of health care delivery. In the following sections, we will see how these elements are interpreted and proven in this setting.

## A. Duty

The first consideration in a negligence case is whether a duty is owed. Duties will be owed whenever the actions of a possible tortfeasor can lead to a foreseeable risk of injury on a separate party. Someone driving a car can obviously cause significant harm to a pedestrian, and so the driver owes the pedestrian a duty to take reasonable care while driving the car.

But what about inaction? What happens when someone fails to act, and in doing so, increases the foreseeable risks of injury to someone else? For example, what if you are walking by a shallow pond and see a small child flailing about—unable to swim and obviously in distress. If you do not act to rescue this child, she is likely to drown—that is the foreseeable risk. You may have an ethical duty to act on behalf of this child's wellbeing, but do you do not have a legal obligation or duty to act.

In general, unless some other duty already exists, e.g., you've agreed to provide babysitting childcare services for the small girl drowning in the pond, people are not under a duty to take some action to save others. However, there are many instances where duties may already exist. For example, there may be a statutory duty that a public hospital must admit a patient seeking treatment. But what about a private hospital? Must private hospitals admit all patients? What if they come to the emergency room? Must they all be treated?

In the following case, the court examines the circumstances in which hospitals will bear duties to patients seeking treatment.

### Case Study: Wilmington General Hospital v. Manlove

**Citation:** 54 Del. 15, 174 A.2d 135 (1961)

#### Facts

This case concerns the liability of a private hospital for the death of an infant who was refused treatment at the emergency ward of the hospital. The facts are these:

On January 4, 1959, Darien E. Manlove, the deceased infant, then four months old, developed diarrhea. The next morning his parents consulted Dr. Hershon. They asked whether the medicine they had for him was all right and the doctor said that it was. In the evening of the same day Mrs. Manlove took the baby's temperature. It was higher than normal. They called Dr. Hershon, and he prescribed additional medication (streptomycin), which he ordered delivered by a pharmacy.

Mrs. Manlove stayed up with the child that night. He did not sleep. On the morning of January 6th the parents took the infant to Dr. Hershon's office. Dr. Thomas examined the child and treated him for sore throat and diarrhea. He prescribed a liquid diet and some medicine.

When Mr. Manlove returned home that night, the baby's condition appeared to be the same. His temperature was still above normal, and again he did not sleep during the night.

On the morning of January 7th (a Wednesday) his temperature was still above normal—102°F. Mr. and Mrs. Manlove determined to seek additional medical assistance. They knew that Dr. Hershon and Dr. Thomas were not in their offices on Wednesdays, and they took their infant to the emergency ward of the Wilmington General Hospital.

#### Hospital's Response

There is no real conflict of fact as to what occurred at the hospital. The parents took the infant into the reception room of the Emergency Ward. A nurse was on duty. They explained to the nurse what was wrong with the child, that is, that he had not slept for two nights, had a continuously high temperature, and that he had diarrhea. Mr. Manlove told the nurse that the child was under the care of Dr. Hershon and Dr. Thomas, and showed the nurse the medicines prescribed.

The nurse explained to the parents that the hospital could not give treatment because the child was under the care of a physician and there would be danger that the medication of the hospital might conflict with that of the attending physician. The nurse did not examine the child, take his temperature, feel his forehead, or look down his throat. The child was not in convulsions, and was not coughing or crying. There was no particular area of body tenderness.

The nurse tried to get in touch with Dr. Hershon or Dr. Thomas in the hospital and at their offices, but was unable to do so. She suggested that the parents bring the baby Thursday morning to the pediatric clinic.

Mr. and Mrs. Manlove returned home. Mrs. Manlove made an appointment by telephone to see Dr. Hershon or Dr. Thomas that night at eight o'clock.

**At eight minutes past three o'clock in the afternoon the baby died of bronchial pneumonia.**

#### Court's Analysis

The court examined whether the hospital had a duty to treat the infant. The court established that:

1. **General Rule**: Private hospitals are not generally required to admit all patients
2. **Emergency Exception**: When a hospital holds itself out as providing emergency services, it may have a duty to provide care
3. **Reliance Doctrine**: If patients reasonably rely on the hospital's representation that it provides emergency care, the hospital may be liable for refusing treatment

#### Court's Decision

The court ruled that the hospital could be liable for the infant's death because:
- The hospital maintained an emergency ward
- The parents reasonably relied on the hospital's availability for emergency care
- The hospital's refusal to examine or treat the infant was unreasonable under the circumstances

This case established the principle that hospitals with emergency departments have a duty to provide at least initial screening and stabilization of patients seeking emergency care.

## Discussion Questions

1. **What policy reasons support requiring hospitals to treat emergency patients?**

2. **Should there be a difference in the duty owed by public versus private hospitals?**

3. **How does this case relate to modern emergency room obligations under EMTALA?**

---

## B. Breach

Once a duty is established, the next question is whether that duty was breached. In the medical malpractice context, this means determining whether the healthcare provider's actions fell below the applicable standard of care.

### Standard of Care

The standard of care in medical malpractice cases is typically defined as the degree of care and skill expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same field, acting under similar circumstances. This standard has evolved over time, particularly regarding:

1. **The need for expert testimony**
2. **The geographic scope of comparison (local vs. national standards)**
3. **Specialization requirements**

### Case Study: Henderson v. Mason

**Citation:** 386 S.W.2d 879 (Tex. Civ. App. El Paso 1964)

#### Facts

On February 11, 1961, while working in Andrews, Texas, the plaintiff received an eye injury when a piece of steel became embedded in his right eye. He was taken to Medical Center Hospital in Odessa for emergency treatment. The defendant, a doctor on voluntary duty in the emergency ward, examined the plaintiff by shining a flashlight in his eye and putting drops in it, then discharged him after 20-30 minutes of treatment.

Later that evening, the plaintiff's eye began bothering him. His wife tried to contact an eye surgeon but was unsuccessful until 9:00 AM the next morning (Sunday). The plaintiff was seen and X-rayed by Dr. Carson around noon on Sunday and was hospitalized. On Monday morning, Dr. Carson operated and removed a small piece of steel from the eye using a magnetized instrument.

The plaintiff later lost sight in his right eye and sued for malpractice, claiming the defendant failed to properly diagnose his condition and did not use an ophthalmoscope or order an X-ray.

#### Court's Analysis

The court addressed several key issues:

**Expert Testimony Requirement:**
- The law presumes physicians act properly and are not guarantors of results
- Physicians must use their best judgment in diagnosis and treatment
- Plaintiffs can only recover when they prove the treatment was not merely an error in judgment, but negligence
- **Expert testimony is required** except in cases obvious to laypeople (e.g., surgical instruments left in patients, operating on wrong body part)

**Burden of Proof:**
The plaintiff must prove by expert testimony:
1. That the diagnosis or treatment constituted negligence
2. That it was the proximate cause of the patient's injuries

**Causation Analysis:**
- The plaintiff's own expert witness (Dr. Carson) testified that the delay from Saturday night to Monday morning "had nothing to do with the loss of vision"
- Dr. Carson stated the cause of vision loss was the injury itself—the metal fragment hit a blood vessel causing bleeding into the vitreous

#### Court's Decision

The court ruled for the defendant because:
- No expert testimony established that defendant was negligent
- The defendant's testimony about the ophthalmoscope (that it wouldn't help in this type of case) was undisputed
- The plaintiff failed to prove causation—his own expert testified the delay didn't cause the vision loss
- The defendant had told plaintiff to see an eye specialist if he had further trouble

### Discussion Questions

1. **Why does the law require expert testimony in most medical malpractice cases?**

2. **How does this case illustrate the difference between an "error in judgment" and "negligence"?**

3. **What role did causation play in the court's decision?**

---

## C. Causation

Proving causation in medical malpractice cases involves two components:
1. **Actual causation** (cause-in-fact)
2. **Proximate causation** (legal cause)

### Loss of Chance Doctrine

A particular challenge in medical malpractice cases arises when determining causation in cases where the patient's survival chances were already compromised. This is known as the "loss of chance" doctrine.

### Case Study: Cooper v. Sisters of Charity

**Citation:** 27 Ohio St. 2d 242, 272 N.E.2d 97 (1971)

#### Facts

On July 22, 1965, 16-year-old Theodore Cooper was struck by a truck while riding his bicycle. That evening, his mother took him to the emergency room at Good Samaritan Hospital. Theodore was able to walk into the hospital unaided but had vomited several times and complained of headaches.

Dr. Hansen examined Theodore, checking his stomach, head, reflexes, grip, and eyes. He ordered X-rays that did not reveal a skull fracture. However, Dr. Hansen did not:
- Examine the back of Theodore's head (where his mother said he was injured)
- Take vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiration)
- Use an ophthalmoscope
- Test the patient's gait
- Perform other diagnostic procedures

Dr. Hansen discharged Theodore with instructions to wake him every hour initially, then every two hours, and to return if he couldn't be awakened, vomited more than twice, or showed other changes. Theodore died early the next morning from a basal skull fracture and brain swelling.

#### The Causation Problem

The key medical testimony came from Dr. Cleveland (the coroner), who stated:
- The injury would have been fatal if left untreated
- There was "no possible way" for anyone to state with certainty that Theodore would have survived even with proper treatment
- However, proper treatment would have given Theodore a "substantial possibility" of survival

#### Court's Analysis

The Ohio Supreme Court addressed the "loss of chance" doctrine, considering two possible standards:

1. **"Reasonable probability" standard:** Plaintiff must prove that proper care would have given the patient a greater than 50% chance of survival
2. **"Substantial possibility" standard:** Plaintiff need only prove that proper care would have given the patient a meaningful chance of survival (could be less than 50%)

#### Court's Decision

The court adopted the "reasonable probability" standard, requiring plaintiffs to prove that proper medical care would more likely than not have prevented the death or injury. The court rejected the "substantial possibility" standard for several reasons:

- It would make healthcare providers liable even when their negligence probably did not cause the harm
- It could lead to excessive liability and defensive medicine
- The traditional "preponderance of evidence" standard requires proof that each element is more likely than not

### Discussion Questions

1. **What are the policy arguments for and against the "loss of chance" doctrine?**

2. **How might the different causation standards affect healthcare providers' behavior?**

3. **Should the standard be different for cases involving young patients versus elderly patients with multiple health issues?**

## D. Informed Consent

Beyond the traditional elements of negligence, medical malpractice law has evolved to include claims based on lack of informed consent. This doctrine recognizes that patients have a right to make informed decisions about their medical care.

### Case Study: Canterbury v. Spence

**Citation:** 464 F.2d 772 (D.C. Cir. 1972)

#### Facts

In 1958, 19-year-old Jerry Canterbury began experiencing severe back pain. After conservative treatment failed, Dr. Spence recommended a laminectomy (spinal surgery). Dr. Spence did not inform Canterbury of the risk of paralysis associated with the procedure.

The surgery was performed in February 1959. The day after surgery, while trying to urinate, Canterbury fell from his hospital bed. He began experiencing paralysis from the waist down. A second operation was performed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord, but Canterbury remained partially paralyzed with ongoing urological problems.

Canterbury sued, claiming Dr. Spence failed to inform him of the risk of paralysis before the surgery.

#### The Court's Analysis

The D.C. Circuit Court established several key principles for informed consent:

**Fundamental Right:**
> "Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body."

**Physician's Duty:**
The court held that physicians have a duty to disclose:
- The nature of the proposed treatment
- Risks and hazards of the treatment
- Alternative treatments available
- Likely results if no treatment is given

**Standard for Disclosure:**
The court rejected the professional standard (what other doctors customarily disclose) in favor of a patient-centered standard:
- **Test:** Whether the risk is "material" to the patient's decision
- **Material risk:** One that a reasonable patient would want to know in deciding whether to consent to treatment
- The law, not medical custom, sets the standard for adequate disclosure

**Exceptions to Disclosure:**
1. **Emergency situations** where delay would jeopardize patient's life or health
2. **Therapeutic privilege** where disclosure would be detrimental to patient's wellbeing
3. **Patient waiver** of the right to be informed

#### Court's Decision

The court ruled that patients have a right to informed consent based on adequate disclosure of material risks, and that this right is not dependent on professional medical customs but on what a reasonable patient would want to know.

### Discussion Questions

1. **How does the informed consent doctrine balance patient autonomy with medical expertise?**

2. **What are the practical challenges of implementing the "material risk" standard?**

3. **When, if ever, should the "therapeutic privilege" exception apply?**

# III. Other Torts in Healthcare

While negligence is the most common tort in healthcare, providers should also be aware of other potential tort claims.

## A. Intentional Torts

### Battery
- **Definition:** Intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person
- **Healthcare context:** Medical treatment without consent
- **Example:** Operating on a patient who refused surgery

### False Imprisonment
- **Definition:** Intentional confinement of another person without justification
- **Healthcare context:** Restraining patients without proper authorization
- **Example:** Preventing a competent patient from leaving the hospital

## B. Strict Liability

### Product Liability
- **Application:** Defective medical devices or pharmaceuticals
- **Standard:** Liability without proof of negligence if product is defective and causes harm
- **Healthcare impact:** Hospitals and physicians may be liable for defective medical products they use

---

# IV. Defenses to Tort Claims

## A. Contributory/Comparative Negligence
- **Contributory negligence:** Complete bar to recovery if plaintiff was negligent
- **Comparative negligence:** Reduces recovery by plaintiff's percentage of fault

## B. Assumption of Risk
- **Voluntary assumption:** Patient knowingly accepts risks of treatment
- **Requirements:** Knowledge of risk and voluntary acceptance

## C. Statute of Limitations
- **Time limits** for filing malpractice claims
- **Discovery rule:** Clock starts when patient discovers or should have discovered the injury

---

# V. Business Implications

## Risk Management Strategies

### Documentation
- Maintain thorough medical records
- Document informed consent discussions
- Record patient communications

### Communication
- Clear communication with patients about risks and alternatives
- Prompt disclosure of adverse events
- Maintain professional relationships

### Insurance Considerations
- Professional liability insurance
- Institutional coverage
- Claims reporting requirements

### Quality Improvement
- Systematic review of adverse events
- Implementation of safety protocols
- Continuing education and training

---

## Conclusion

Tort law, particularly medical malpractice, significantly impacts healthcare delivery and business operations. Understanding the elements of negligence, the requirements for proving medical malpractice, and the evolving standards for informed consent is essential for healthcare providers and administrators. Effective risk management strategies can help minimize exposure while maintaining quality patient care.
