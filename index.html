The Case of Baby Kyle</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Welsh v. Bulger</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">548 Pa. 504 (Sup Ct. Pa 1997).</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In 1989, Bobbi Jo Welsh, then sixteen years of age, received prenatal care from Donald W. Bulger, M.D., and his practice at Claysburg Medical Associates, Inc. in Claysburg, Pennsylvania. At that time, Dr. Bulger had obstetrical privileges at Nason Hospital but these privileges did not permit him to perform surgery at the hospital.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">At approximately 4:00 a.m. on January 1, 1990, Welsh began experiencing contractions. She arrived at Nason Hospital at approximately noon and the nursing staff conducted an initial internal examination, which revealed that Welsh’s cervix was dilated five centimeters and that her membranes were intact. Dr. Bulger first examined Welsh at 7:55 p.m. and performed an amniotomy, i.e., an artificial rupture of the fetal membranes as a means of expediting or inducing labor. Dr. Bulger also placed an internal monitoring device on the fetus to monitor the fetal heart rate. Welsh’s cervix became fully dilated at 8:15 p.m. and Dr. Bulger instructed her to begin pushing out the baby. By 9:13 p.m., the fetal monitoring device indicated that the fetal heart rate had experienced consecutive nonassuring variable deceleration patterns, suggesting possible interference of umbilical blood flow to the fetus. The fetal monitoring device continued to show nonassuring variable deceleration patterns until approximately 9:38 p.m., when monitoring was discontinued.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">At approximately 9:50 p.m., Welsh was transferred to the delivery room. Dr. Bulger vaginally delivered the child with forceps at approximately 10:35 p.m. Following the delivery, Bobbi named the child Kyle. His failure to thrive was marked by a dusky color, lack of muscle tone, and a low heart rate. Kyle had Apgar scores of four at one minute after delivery and six at five minutes after delivery. Apgar scores are an evaluation of a newborn infant’s physical status that assigns numerical values (zero to two) to each of five criteria: heart rate,
217
respiratory effort, muscle tone, response to stimulation, and skin color. A total score of eight to ten indicates the best possible condition.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">At approximately 11:25 p.m., the child was transferred to Altoona Hospital for additional care. After the child was released from Altoona Hospital, he suffered numerous complications and required several hospitalizations. On November 27, 1990, the child died at the age of eleven months.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Ms. Welsh sued Dr. Bulger, Claysburg Medical Associates, Inc., and Nason Hospital. The claims against Nason Hospital are couched in negligence and are premised on separate theories of vicarious liability and direct liability. First, Welsh alleges that Nason Hospital is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of its staff in failing to monitor and to respond to an infant showing signs of fetal distress. Second, Welsh alleges that Nason Hospital is directly liable for its own negligence because it granted non-surgical obstetrical privileges to Dr. Bulger without requiring a qualified surgeon to be available in case surgery was necessary and because its staff failed to notify the hospital that Welsh’s child needed a surgical delivery.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">At the conclusion of this chapter we’ll explain how the court ruled, but before going further consider the following questions:</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">It is a tragedy that Baby Kyle passed so young, but does it seem fair—legally or ethically—that Nason Hospital should be responsible for this terrible consequence?
Even assuming that the medical care provided by Dr. Bulger was negligent, i.e., malpractice that resulted in Kyle’s death, should the hospital be held accountable?
What are the duties of a healthcare organization when it comes to patient care, which, of course, is in the hands of individual physicians and nurses?

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Health care organizations can be held directly accountable for accidents that occur partly as a result of their own negligence. A patient may be injured due to inadequate care of a specific doctor, but the health care organization to which that doctor was connected may be responsible for putting that patient with that specific doctor. A doctor may have the ultimate say over whether a patient is discharged, but an insurance plan that unreasonably limits approval of an extension of care may also be considered negligent.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">When the negligent actions of two different parties contribute to the ultimate injury, the two parties are considered joint tortfeasors.1 As such, both parties will face what is called joint and several liability. Under joint and several liability, a winning plaintiff can recover the full amount of the award from either defendant, and the paying defendant will have to seek contributions from the other defendant. Consequently, to maximize the probability that they can collect their full award, plaintiffs will frequently want to include defendants with “deep pockets” such as some health care organizations. Consequently, health care organizations should be aware of how their own actions may lead to direct tort liability, sometimes referred to as “corporate negligence.”</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">A.The End of Immunity</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">For a long time, many health care organizations were exempt from liability under the charitable immunity doctrine. However, changes in health care delivery away from charitable institutions led courts to limit these exceptions. In the following case, a college student is treated for a broken leg at a community hospital emergency room in 1960. Errors in his treatment led to the amputation of part of his leg. The defendant hospital tries to assert that it cannot be liable because corporations are not authorized to practice medicine. It also tries to apply the charitable
219
immunity doctrine, to limit its liability. However, the Illinois Supreme Court clarifies the position that these limits are no longer applicable.</p></div><textarea x-model="n['direct']"placeholder="Notes..."class="w-full mt-10 p-5 border-2 border-slate-300 focus:border-black focus:outline-none font-mono text-sm"rows="8"></textarea><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><button @click="goTo('overview')"class="px-8 py-4 border-2 border-black hover:bg-slate-100">←BACK</button><button @click="mark('direct');goTo('darling')"class="px-10 py-4 bg-black text-white font-bold">CONTINUE→</button></div></div><div x-show="s==='darling'"x-cloak class="fade-in bg-white border-2 border-black p-16"><h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-12">Darling</h2><div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-10 space-y-6"><p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Darling v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">33 Ill. 2d 326, 211 N.E.2d 253 (1965).</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">This action was brought . . . to recover damages for allegedly negligent medical and hospital treatment which necessitated the amputation of his right leg below the knee. The jury returned a verdict against the hospital . . . . The judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $110,000 was affirmed on appeal by the Appellate Court for the Fourth District. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On November 5, 1960, the plaintiff, who was 18 years old, broke his leg while playing in a college football game. He was taken to the emergency room at the defendant hospital where Dr. Alexander, who was on emergency call that day, treated him. Dr. Alexander, with the assistance of hospital personnel, applied traction and placed the leg in a plaster cast. A heat cradle was applied to dry the cast. Not long after the application of the cast plaintiff was in great pain and his toes, which protruded from the cast, became swollen and dark in color. They eventually became cold and insensitive. On the evening of November 6, Dr. Alexander “notched” the cast around the toes, and on the afternoon of the next day he cut the cast approximately three inches up from the foot. On November 8 he split the sides of the cast with a Stryker saw; in the course of cutting the cast the plaintiff’s leg was cut on both sides. Blood and other seepage were observed by the nurses and others, and there was a stench in the room, which one witness said was the worst he had smelled since World War II. The plaintiff . . . was transferred to Barnes Hospital in St. Louis and placed under the care of Dr. Fred Reynolds, head of orthopedic surgery at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Hospital. Dr. Reynolds found that the fractured leg contained a considerable amount of dead tissue which in his opinion resulted from interference with the circulation of blood in the limb caused by swelling or hemorrhaging of
220
the leg against the constriction of the cast. Dr. Reynolds performed several operations in a futile attempt to save the leg but ultimately it had to be amputated eight inches below the knee.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">. . . The plaintiff contends that it established that the defendant was negligent in permitting Dr. Alexander to do orthopedic work of the kind required in this case, and not requiring him to review his operative procedures to bring them up to date; in failing, through its medical staff, to exercise adequate supervision over the case, especially since Dr. Alexander had been placed on emergency duty by the hospital, and in not requiring consultation, particularly after complications had developed. Plaintiff contends also that in a case which developed as this one did, it was the duty of the nurses to watch the protruding toes constantly for changes of color, temperature and movement, and to check circulation every ten to twenty minutes, whereas the proof showed that these things were done only a few times a day. Plaintiff argues that it was the duty of the hospital staff to see that these procedures were followed, and that either the nurses were derelict in failing to report developments in the case to the hospital administrator, he was derelict in bringing them to the attention of the medical staff, or the staff was negligent in failing to take action. Defendant is a licensed and accredited hospital, and the plaintiff contends that the licensing regulations, accreditation standards, and its own bylaws define the hospital’s duty, and that an infraction of them imposes liability for the resulting injury.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The defendant’s position is stated in the following excerpts from its brief: “It is a fundamental rule of law that only an individual properly educated and licensed, and not a corporation, may practice medicine . . . Accordingly, a hospital is powerless under the law to forbid or command any act by a physician or surgeon in the practice of his profession . . . A hospital is not an insurer of the patient’s recovery, but only owes the patient the duty to exercise such reasonable care as his known condition requires and that degree of care, skill and diligence used by hospitals generally in that community. . . . The extent of the duty of a hospital with respect to actual medical care of a professional</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">221
nature such as is furnished by a physician is to use reasonable care in selecting medical doctors. When such care in the selection of the staff is accomplished, and nothing indicates that a physician so selected is incompetent or that such incompetence should have been discovered, more cannot be expected from the hospital administration.” . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">[However,] “the conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient, does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses, but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own responsibility, no longer reflects the fact. Present-day hospitals, as their manner of operation plainly demonstrates, do far more than furnish facilities for treatment. They regularly employ on a salary basis a large staff of physicians, nurses and internes, as well as administrative and manual workers, and they charge patients for medical care and treatment, collecting for such services, if necessary, by legal action. Certainly, the person who avails himself of ‘hospital facilities’ expects that the hospital will attempt to cure him, not that its nurses or other employees will act on their own responsibility.” . . . The Standards for Hospital Accreditation, the state licensing regulations and the defendant’s bylaws demonstrate that the medical profession and other responsible authorities regard it as both desirable and feasible that a hospital assume certain responsibilities for the care of the patient.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">We now turn to an application of these considerations to this case. . . . On the basis of the evidence before it the jury could reasonably have concluded that the nurses did not test for circulation in the leg as frequently as necessary, that skilled nurses would have promptly recognized the conditions that signaled a dangerous impairment of circulation in the plaintiff’s leg, and would have known that the condition would become irreversible in a matter of hours. At that point it became the nurses’ duty to inform the attending physician, and if he failed to act, to advise the hospital authorities so that appropriate action might be taken. As to consultation, there is no dispute that the hospital failed to review Dr. Alexander’s work or require a consultation; the only issue is whether its failure to do so was negligence. On the evidence before it the jury could reasonably have found that it was.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">222
Another contention of the defendant is that the judgment for $110,000 must be reduced to $100,000, the limit of its liability insurance, because its insurance is its only nontrust fund asset. The appellate court disposed of this contention on the ground that the defendant’s allegations failed to establish that other nontrust funds did not exist. The plaintiff, however, suggests that the doctrine of charitable immunity announced in Parks v. Northwestern University, and modified in Moore v. Moyle, did not survive the decision of this court in Molitor v. Kaneland Community Unit District. It is appropriate that we dispose of the broader contention.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Moore v. Moyle qualified the doctrine of charitable immunity by permitting recovery against nontrust funds of a charitable corporation, specifically an insurance policy. In other respects it adhered to the doctrine of immunity expressed in Parks v. Northwestern University. In the Molitor case the immunity of school districts was sought to be justified upon the theory that it was required in order to protect public funds. In disposing of this contention we said: “We do not believe that in this present day and age, when public education constitutes one of the biggest businesses in the country, that school immunity can be justified on the protection-of-public-funds theory.” . . . We agree that the doctrine of charitable immunity can no longer stand in the light of Molitor v. Kaneland Community Unit District. In addition to the reasons advanced in the Molitor case, a doctrine which limits the liability of charitable corporations to the amount of liability insurance that they see fit to carry permits them to determine whether or not they will be liable for their torts and the amount of that liability, if any. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The judgment of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District is affirmed.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In addition to addressing the issue of immunity, the Darling case also demonstrates one way that a hospital may be held directly negligent: for inadequately supervising and monitoring its medical staff. To protect patients, hospitals are expected to monitor and review patients’ treatment. While doctors are not expected to guarantee results, nonetheless, treatment plans should be expected to be based on a periodic review of the patient’s condition and should not significantly deviate from established norms of treatment. Hospitals also should conduct these reviews to ensure that the responsible physician is giving each patient the proper attention. These principles lead to the imposition on hospitals of general duties to monitor and supervise the doctors employed by them.</p>

2.Selection</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">As mentioned above in Darling, another way that a hospital may be negligent is by not exercising enough care in selecting its physicians. When a physician is initially hired by a hospital, it is the responsibility of the hospital to ensure that the physician has sufficient education, training, and experience for the particular position. These questions must be asked again when the hospital specifies a particular assignment for a physician, such as attending the emergency room, or in continuing to employ that physician. These duties apply also to hospitals which permit their facilities to be used by “independent contractors.”2 In the following case, a hospital continued to allow a physician to use its facilities after it became aware of a malpractice suit against him. The hospital is then sued for negligence by a subsequent patient of this physician.</p></div><textarea x-model="n['darling']"placeholder="Notes..."class="w-full mt-10 p-5 border-2 border-slate-300 focus:border-black focus:outline-none font-mono text-sm"rows="8"></textarea><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><button @click="goTo('overview')"class="px-8 py-4 border-2 border-black hover:bg-slate-100">←BACK</button><button @click="mark('darling');goTo('elam')"class="px-10 py-4 bg-black text-white font-bold">CONTINUE→</button></div></div><div x-show="s==='elam'"x-cloak class="fade-in bg-white border-2 border-black p-16"><h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-12">Elam</h2><div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-10 space-y-6"><p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Elam v. College Park Hospital</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">132 Cal. App. 3d 332, 183 Cal. Rptr. 156 (1982).</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The pivotal question presented by this appeal is whether a hospital is liable to a patient under the doctrine of corporate negligence for negligent conduct of independent physicians and surgeons who, as members of the hospital staff, avail themselves of the hospital facilities, but who are neither employees nor agents of the hospital. We answer this question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">After Sophia Elam filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice against doctors Martin J. Schur, Merrill F. Cahn and Samuel Markarian, and College Park Hospital (Hospital), Hospital was granted summary judgment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Elam complains [that] Schur, a licensed podiatrist, performed negligent podiatric surgery at Hospital to correct bilateral bunions and bilateral hammer toes. She was admitted to Hospital for surgery by Schur and Markarian, a medical doctor, pursuant to a hospital coadmission
225
procedure requiring concurrence of a medical doctor before admitting a podiatric patient and the physician’s assumption of responsibility for the overall medical care of that patient, including the taking of a medical history and the performance of a physical examination to insure podiatric surgery is not contraindicated. The surgery was performed by Schur and Cahn.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Schur was always an independent contractor with Hospital and never an employee or agent. He was never paid by Hospital, as he operated his own office and billed Elam directly. She had personally selected him for medical treatment. In June 1974 he applied for appointment to Hospital’s medical staff. After verifying his doctor of podiatric medicine degree, state podiatric license, and podiatric surgery privileges at Hillside and Heartland Hospitals in San Diego, Hospital’s governing board granted Schur podiatric surgery privileges on April 25, 1975.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Between April 25, 1975 and the date of surgery, Hospital’s medical care evaluation committee (later renamed patient care evaluation committee), was responsible for evaluating and improving the quality of care rendered to patients treated at Hospital. The committee met monthly, reviewing the medical charts of doctors and podiatrists treating patients at Hospital. On this routine basis, Schur’s medical charts were reviewed along with the charts of other doctors and podiatrists. The committee constituted a peer review mechanism designed to continually monitor, evaluate and improve the quality of medical care furnished patients at Hospital in compliance with the standards of the JCAH. The committee never complained or reported to the Hospital’s administration it considered or had reason to consider Schur incompetent or unqualified to practice podiatric surgery. . . . Hospital admits it learned of the Bailey malpractice suit against Schur approximately four and one-half months before Elam’s surgery. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Elam asserts Hospital breached its duty to her of insuring the competence of its staff physicians. . . . The essential elements of actionable negligence include: (1) a defendant’s legal duty to use due care; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) the breach as the proximate or
226
legal cause of the resulting injury. . . . Hospital argues it does not owe its patients a legal duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting, reviewing and periodically evaluating the competency of the physicians and podiatrists it permits to treat patients within its facilities. Therefore, even if its unreasonable actions were a proximate cause of Elam’s injuries, it may not be held liable on a negligence theory. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the doctrine of corporate hospital liability should be applied, we must determine whether the cited legal duty of care exists. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Case precedent establishes a hospital has a duty of reasonable care to protect patients from harm . . . We can perceive of no reason why this established duty of due care does not encompass the duty asserted by Elam; for, as a general principle, a hospital’s failure to insure the competence of its medical staff through careful selection and review creates an unreasonable risk of harm to its patients. . . . The hospital’s duty to guard against physicians’ incompetency is further implied by requiring renewal of staff privileges at least every two years (implying a periodic competency review) and the periodic review of the medical records of hospital patients. . . . Further, our conclusion is consonant with the public’s perception of the modern hospital as a multifaceted, health-care facility responsible for the quality of medical care and treatment rendered. . . . Moreover, imposing the duty of care upon a hospital should have the “prophylactic” effect of supplying the hospital with a greater incentive to assure the competence of its medical staff and the quality of medical care rendered within its walls. . . . In summary, we hold a hospital is accountable for negligently screening the competency of its medical staff to insure the adequacy of medical care rendered to patients at its facility.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In light of our conclusion Hospital owes generally a duty to insure the competency of its medical staff and to evaluate the quality of medical treatment rendered on its premises, the filed papers pertaining to the motion for summary judgment are replete with triable issues of fact. For example, whether Hospital should have conducted an investigation through its peer review committee upon notice of the Bailey case?
227
Whether the committee had conducted its periodic reviews of Schur in a nonnegligent manner? Assuming a review was made after notice of the Bailey case, was it performed in a nonnegligent manner? If it had been made in a careful and proper manner, would the committee have recommended revocation or suspension of Schur’s staff privileges?</p>

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">An area where an insurance plan may face direct liability for negligence is in the application of utilization review processes. Utilization review happens when the health plan reviews a physician’s request for approval of a specific treatment. It acts as a secondary check on treatment decisions, mostly done for the purpose of containing costs. Managed care organizations that are concerned with cost-effective delivery of care may also implement a form of utilization review.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">These reviews must be done with an appropriate level of care however, because the patient may be affected by a denied treatment. The determination of this level is fact-specific. The following two cases came out of California within five years of each other. In the first, the
228
court found that the plan was not negligent, but in the other, the court found sufficient evidence of possible negligence to remand the case back to the trial court.</p></div><div class="mt-16 border-2 border-indigo-400 bg-white p-12"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-10 border-b-2 border-indigo-500 pb-6"><i data-lucide="messages-square" class="w-10 h-10"></i><div class="flex-1"><h4 class="font-bold text-3xl">Discussion Posts</h4></div><span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-bold text-xl">4</span></div><div class="space-y-8"><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">1</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Elliot Olson</h5><span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Student</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">Elam v.

California</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">192 Cal. App. 3d 1630, 239 Cal. Rptr. 810 (1986).</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">This is an appeal from a judgment for plaintiff entered after a trial by jury. For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the judgment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Principally, this matter concerns itself with the legal responsibility that a third party payor, in this case, the State of California, has for harm caused to a patient when a cost containment program is applied in a manner which is alleged to have affected the implementation of the treating physician’s medical judgment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The plaintiff, respondent herein, Lois J. Wickline (plaintiff or Wickline) sued defendant, appellant herein, State of California (State of Medi-Cal). The essence of the plaintiff’s claim is found in paragraph 16 of her second amended complaint which alleges: “ . . . an employee of the State of California, while acting within the scope of employment, negligently discontinued plaintiff’s Medi-Cal eligibility, causing plaintiff to be discharged from Van Nuys Community Hospital prematurely and whil [sic] in need of continuing hospital care. As a result of said negligent act, plaintiff suffered a complete occlusion of the right infra-renoaorta, necessitating an amputation of plaintiff’s right leg.” . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Responding to concerns about the escalating cost of health care, public and private payors have in recent years experimented with a variety of cost containment mechanisms. We deal here with one of those programs: The prospective utilization review process. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In the cost-containment program in issue in this case, prospective utilization review, authority for the rendering of health care services must be obtained before medical care is rendered. Its purpose is to promote the well recognized public interest in controlling health care costs by reducing unnecessary services while still intending to assure that appropriate medical and hospital services are provided to the
229
patient in need. However, such a cost-containment strategy creates new and added pressures on the quality assurance portion of the utilization review mechanism. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In 1976, Wickline a married woman in her mid-40’s, with a limited education, was being treated by Dr. Stanley Z. Daniels (Dr. Daniels), a physician engaged in a general family practice, for problems associated with her back and legs. Failing to respond to the physical therapy type of treatment he prescribed, Dr. Daniels had Wickline admitted to Van Nuys Community Hospital (Van Nuys or Hospital) in October 1976 and brought in another physician, Dr. Gerald E. Polonsky (Dr. Polonsky), a specialist in peripheral vascular surgery, to do a consultation examination. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Polonsky examined plaintiff and diagnosed her condition as arteriosclerosis obliterans with occlusion of the abdominal aorta, more generally referred to as Leriche’s Syndrome. Leriche’s Syndrome is a condition caused by the obstruction of the terminal aorta. . . . In plaintiff’s situation, the occlusion occurred just above the point where the aorta divides into two common iliac arteries which descend, respectively, into each leg. The occlusion was due to arteriosclerosis. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">According to Dr. Polonsky, the only treatment for Leriche’s Syndrome is surgical. In Wickline’s case her disease was so far advanced that Dr. Polonsky concluded that it was necessary to remove a part of the plaintiff’s artery and insert a synthetic (Teflon) graft in its place.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">After agreeing to the operation, Wickline was discharged home to await approval of her doctor’s diagnosis and authorization from Medi-Cal for the recommended surgical procedure and attendant acute care hospitalization. . . . Dr. Daniels submitted a treatment authorization request to Medi-Cal, . . . . In response to Dr. Daniels’ request, Medi-Cal authorized the surgical procedure and 10 days of hospitalization for that treatment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On January 6, 1977, plaintiff was admitted to Van Nuys by Dr. Daniels. On January 7, 1977, Dr. Polonsky performed a surgical procedure in
230
which a part of plaintiff’s artery was removed and a synthetic artery was inserted to replace it. Dr. Polonsky characterized that procedure as “a very major surgery.”</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Later that same day Dr. Polonsky was notified that Wickline was experiencing circulatory problems in her right leg. He concluded that a clot had formed in the graft. As a result, Wickline was taken back into surgery, the incision in her right groin was reopened, the clot removed and the graft was resewn. Wickline’s recovery subsequent to the two January 7th operations was characterized as “stormy.” She had a lot of pain, some spasm in the vessels in the lower leg and she experienced hallucinating episodes. On January 12, 1977, Wickline was returned to the operating room where Dr. Polonsky performed a lumbar sympathectomy. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The procedure causes the blood vessels in the patient’s lower extremity to become paralyzed in a wide open position and was done in an attempt to relieve the spasms which Wickline was experiencing in those vessels. Spasms stop the outflow of blood from the vessels causing the blood to back up into the graft. Failure to relieve such spasms can cause clotting. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On or about January 16, 1977, Dr. Polonsky concluded that “it was medically necessary” that plaintiff remain in the hospital for an additional eight days beyond her then scheduled discharge date. Drs. Kovner and Daniels concurred in Dr. Polonsky’s opinion. Dr. Polonsky cited many reasons for his feeling that it was medically necessary for plaintiff to remain in an acute care hospital for an additional eight days, such as the danger of infection and/or clotting. His principal reason, however, was that he felt that he was going to be able to save both of Wickline’s legs and wanted her to remain in the hospital where he could observe her and be immediately available, along with the hospital staff, to treat her if an emergency should occur.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In order to secure an extension of Wickline’s hospital stay, it was necessary to complete and present to Medi-Cal a form called “Request for Extension of Stay in Hospital, “commonly referred to as an “MC-
231
180” or “180.” . . . At Van Nuys . . . a registered nurse . . . filled out Wickline’s 180 form and then presented it to Dr. Daniels, as plaintiff’s attending physician, to sign, which he did, in compliance with Dr. Polonsky’s recommendation. All of the physicians who testified agreed that the 180 form prepared by [the nurse] was complete, accurate and adequate for all purposes in issue in this matter.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Doris A. Futerman (Futerman), a registered nurse . . . employed by Medi-Cal . . . had the authority, after reviewing a 180 form, to approve the requested extension of time without calling a Medi-Cal Consultant. She could not, however, either reject the request outright or authorize a lesser number of days than requested. If, for any reason, she felt she could not approve the extension of time in the hospital as requested, she was required to contact a Medi-Cal Consultant and that physician would make the ultimate decision on the request.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Futerman, after reviewing Wickline’s 180 form, felt that she could not approve the requested eight-day extension of acute care hospitalization. While conceding that the information provided might justify some additional time beyond the scheduled discharge date, nothing in Wickline’s case, in Futerman’s opinion, would have warranted the entire eight additional days requested and, for those reasons, she telephoned the Medi-Cal Consultant. She reached Dr. William S. Glassman (Dr. Glassman), one of the Medi-Cal Consultants. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">After speaking with Futerman on the telephone, Dr. Glassman rejected Wickline’s treating physician’s request for an eight-day hospital extension and, instead, authorized an additional four days of hospital stay beyond the originally scheduled discharge date.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Glassman testified that since the initial request for extension of hospital stay is made to him by way of a telephone call from the on-site nurse, he does not actually see the 180 form itself until after he has acted on it, when it is forwarded to him for his signature. While there are appropriate places provided on the 180 form to indicate what the on-site nurse’s recommendation is and the reason given for disapproval of the requested hospital stay extension by the Medi-Cal Consultant,
232
both of those places were left blank on Wickline’s 180 form. Dr. Glassman could not recall why he granted a four-day extension rather than the eight days requested by plaintiff’s treating physician.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Neither Futerman nor Dr. Glassman had any specific recollection of the Wickline case. Each testified based upon their ordinary practice and procedure except where requested to state their opinion based on information provided to them at the time their respective testimony was taken as, for example, regarding information appearing on Wickline’s 180 form.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">After review of Wickline’s 180 form, Dr. Glassman testified that the factors that led him to authorize four days, rather than the requested eight days, was that there was no information about the patient’s temperature which he, thereupon, assumed was normal; nothing was mentioned about the patient’s diet, which he then presumed was not a problem; nor was there any information about Wickline’s bowel function, which Dr. Glassman then presumed was functioning satisfactorily. Further, the fact that the 180 form noted that Wickline was able to ambulate with help and that whirlpool treatments were to begin that day caused Dr. Glassman to presume that the patient was progressing satisfactorily and was not seriously or critically ill. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In essence, respondent argues, Dr. Glassman based his decision on signs and symptoms such as temperature, diet and bowel movements, which were basically irrelevant to the plaintiff’s circulatory condition for which she was being treated and did not concern himself with those symptoms and signs which an ordinary prudent physician would consider to be pertinent with regard to the type of medical condition presented by Wickline.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Complying with the limited extension of time authorized by Medi-Cal, Wickline was discharged from Van Nuys on January 21, 1977. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">[At] the time of her scheduled discharge on January 21, 1977, Wickline’s condition had neither deteriorated nor become critical. In Dr. Polonsky’s opinion no new symptom had presented itself and no additional factors had occurred since the original request was made to
233
have formed the basis for a change in the Medi-Cal Consultant’s attitude regarding Wickline’s situation. In addition, he stated that at the time of Wickline’s discharge it did not appear that her leg was in any danger. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Just prior to Wickline’s actual discharge from the hospital, which she protested, Dr. Kovner met with her husband and explained to him how he was to administer to his wife’s needs at home. That care consisted primarily of antibiotic powder for the groin incision, medication, warm water baths and bed rest.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Wickline testified that in the first few days after she arrived home she started feeling pain in her right leg and the leg started to lose color. In the next few days the pain got worse and the right leg took on a whitish, statue-like marble appearance. Wickline assumed she was experiencing normal recovery symptoms and did not communicate with any of her physicians. Finally, when “the pain got so great and the color started changing from looking like a statue to getting a grayish color,” her husband called Dr. Kovner. It was Wickline’s memory that this occurred about the third day after her discharge from the hospital and that Dr. Kovner advised Mr. Wickline to give extra pain medicine to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Thereafter, gradually over the next few days, the plaintiff’s leg “kept getting grayer and then it got bluish.” The extra medication allegedly prescribed by Dr. Kovner over the telephone did not relieve the pain Wickline was experiencing. She testified that “by then the pain was just excruciating, where no pain medicine helped whatsoever.” Finally, Wickline instructed her husband to call Dr. Kovner again and this time Dr. Kovner ordered plaintiff back into the hospital. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On examination, after admission, Dr. Kovner found an open wound in the right groin area, a secondary infection in the femoral incision on the right, a mottled foot (areas of white mixed with areas of blue discoloration or pink discoloration) and a right leg that was cooler than the left leg. Wickline was experiencing severe unrelenting pain in the right lower extremity. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">234
Dr. Polonsky concluded that Wickline had developed clotting in the right leg, that there was no circulation to that leg, and that she had developed an infection at the graft site. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Because of the presence of the infection in the groin, Dr. Polonsky was unable to remove the clot surgically. To have attempted to do so, in Dr. Polonsky’s opinion, would have resulted in spreading the graft’s infection throughout the body, through the circulatory system, resulting in repetitive clotting and possible death from septicemia, blood poisoning.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Attempts to save Wickline’s leg through the utilization of anticoagulants, antibiotics, strict bed rest, pain medication and warm water whirlpool baths to the lower extremity proved unsuccessful. On February 8, 1977, Dr. Polonsky amputated Wickline’s leg below the knee because had he not done so “she would have died.” The condition did not, however, heal after the first operation and on February 17, 1977, the doctors went back and amputated Wickline’s leg above the knee.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Had the eight-day extension requested on Wickline’s behalf been granted by Medi-Cal, she would have remained in the hospital through the morning hours of January 25, 1977. In Dr. Polonsky’s medical opinion, based upon hypothetical questions derived from Wickline’s recollection of her course subsequent to her discharge from the hospital, had she been at Van Nuys on January 22, 23 or 24, he would have observed her leg change color, would have formed the opinion that she had clotted and would have taken her back into surgery and reopened the graft to remove the clot again, not an uncommon procedure in this type of case. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In Dr. Polonsky’s opinion, to a reasonable medical certainty, had Wickline remained in the hospital for the eight additional days, as originally requested by him and her other treating doctors, she would not have suffered the loss of her leg. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Polonsky testified that in his medical opinion, the Medi-Cal Consultant’s rejection of the requested eight-day extension of acute
235
care hospitalization and his authorization of a four-day extension in its place did not conform to the usual medical standards as they existed in 1977. He stated that, in accordance with those standards, a physician would not be permitted to make decisions regarding the care of a patient without either first seeing the patient, reviewing the patient’s chart or discussing the patient’s condition with her treating physician or physicians.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">From the facts thus presented, appellant takes the position that it was not negligent as a matter of law. Appellant contends that the decision to discharge was made by each of the plaintiff’s three doctors, was based upon the prevailing standards of practice, and was justified by her condition at the time of her discharge. It argues that Medi-Cal had no part in the plaintiff’s hospital discharge and therefore was not liable even if the decision to do so was erroneously made by her doctors. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Kaufman, the chief Medi-Cal Consultant for the Los Angeles field office . . . supported Dr. Glassman’s decision. He testified, based upon his examination of the MC-180 form in issue in this matter, that Dr. Glassman’s four-day hospital stay extension authorization was ample to meet the plaintiff’s medically necessary needs at that point in time. Further, in Dr. Kaufman’s opinion, there was no need for Dr. Glassman to seek information beyond that which was contained in Wickline’s 180 form. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Each side’s medical expert witnesses agreed that, in accordance with the standards of medical practice as it existed in January 1977, it was for the patient’s treating physician to decide the course of treatment that was medically necessary to treat the ailment. It was also that physician’s responsibility to determine whether or not acute care hospitalization was required and for how long. . . . The decision to discharge is, therefore, the responsibility of the patient’s own treating doctor. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">If, in his medical judgment, it was in his patient’s best interest that she remain in the acute care hospital setting for an additional four days
236
beyond the extended time period originally authorized by Medi-Cal, Dr. Polonsky should have made some effort to keep Wickline there. . . . It was his medical judgment, however, that Wickline could be discharged when she was. . . . Medi-Cal did not override the medical judgment of Wickline’s treating physicians at the time of her discharge. . . . Therefore, there can be no viable cause of action against it for the consequences of that discharge decision.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">This court appreciates that what is at issue here is the effect of cost-containment programs upon the professional judgment of physicians to prescribe hospital treatment for patients requiring the same. While we recognize, realistically, that cost consciousness has become a permanent feature of the health care system, it is essential that cost limitation programs not be permitted to corrupt medical judgment. We have concluded, from the facts in issue here, that in this case it did not.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">For the reasons expressed herein, this court finds that appellant is not liable for respondent’s injuries as a matter of law. That makes unnecessary any discussion of the other contentions of the parties.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The judgment is reversed.

Blue Cross of Southern California</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">222 Cal. App. 3d 660, 271 Cal. Rptr. 876 (1990).</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On March 1, 1983, Howard Wilson, Jr. (the decedent), was admitted to College Hospital in Los Angeles while suffering from major depression, drug dependency, and anorexia. His treating physician determined that he needed three to four weeks of in-patient care at the hospital. On March 11, 1983, through its agents, the decedent’s insurance company announced that it would not pay for any further hospital care. Because nobody could afford to pay for any further in-patient hospital care, the decedent was discharged from College Hospital. On March 31, 1983, the decedent committed suicide. Because a triable issue exists as to whether the conduct of the decedent’s insurance company and certain related entities was a substantial factor in causing the decedent’s death, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly granted the summary judgment motions. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Unlike a normal opinion where procedural and factual matters are initially developed, this case lends itself to the resolution of the key legal issue at the outset—the extent to which Wickline extends beyond the context of Medi-Cal patients to an insured under an insurance policy issued in the private sector. Because Wickline should be limited to its facts and the legal issues properly decided in that case, it may not serve as a basis for the orders granting the summary judgment motions filed in this case. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In essence, Wickline is a case involving three key legal and factual components. First, as a matter of law, the discharge decision met the standard of care for physicians. This is of particular importance given the fact that the Medi-Cal standard for determining whether to provide acute care was essentially the same as the standard of care for physicians. Second, the funding process was not pursuant to a contract; rather, the determination as to whether the state had a duty to provide funds was made pursuant to statute and provisions of the California Administrative Code. . . . Third, Wickline was not a case where a cost
238
limitation program such as the Medi-Cal review process was “permitted to corrupt medical judgment.” . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Western Medical performed concurrent utilization reviews of the “medical necessity” for Blue Cross insureds at College Hospital in March 1983. . . . The decedent was admitted to College Hospital on March 1, 1983, for major depression and loss of 20 pounds in 2 months. Dr. Taff’s treatment plan called for the decedent to remain hospitalized for three to four weeks. Dr. Taff believed that “reasonable treatment” of the decedent required inpatient treatment on March 11, 1983. In 1983, Western Medical applied federal Medi-Care utilization review standards to private insurance patients. Prior to March 11, 1983, Dr. Taff was impressed with the decedent’s prognosis. However, he was informed by Western Medical that the decedent’s stay was “not justified or approved.” In Dr. Taff’s opinion the decedent required further in-patient treatment and the appropriate medical care could not be provided on an out-patient basis. Dr. Taff testified that it was reasonably probable to assume that there was a “reasonable medical probability” that the decedent would have been alive if his hospital stay had not been prematurely terminated.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Taff informed the decedent of Western Medical’s decision “that the patient did not meet the admission criteria for his particular insurance policy and that his further stay was not justified or approved.” The decedent was informed that he would “not be covered financially by his insurance company and that the liability [for hospital costs] would then be his.” The decedent was “not happy with the decision. . . .” The decedent cried while talking to an aunt about the determination that he was to be released from the hospital because the insurance company would not pay for the benefits. The decedent’s aunt testified at her deposition that the family did not have enough money to pay for the cost of in-patient hospitalization. Dr. Taff told the aunt of the decedent “to come and get him.” Dr. Taff told the decedent’s mother and father that Western Medical “terminated his [the decedent’s] stay” and the decedent’s father was told that this was a “problem” that had occurred on other occasions. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">239
In the present case, there is substantial evidence that Western Medical’s decision not to approve further hospitalization was a substantial factor in bringing about the decedent’s demise. It was Western Medical which conducted the concurrent utilization review and directed that no further benefits be paid. . . . Once the insurance benefits were terminated, there were no other funds to pay for the decedent’s hospitalization. The sole reason for the discharge, based on the evidence adduced in connection with the summary judgment motion, was that the decedent had no insurance or money to pay for any further in-patient benefits. Dr. Taff, the decedent’s treating physician, believed that had the decedent completed his planned hospitalization there was a reasonable medical probability that he would not have committed suicide. The foregoing constitutes sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether Western Medical’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the decedent’s death.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Western Medical argues that it was entitled to summary judgment because there are important public policy considerations which warrant protecting insurance companies and related entities which conduct concurrent utilization review. 6 Western Medical cites language in Wickline which indicates that utilization review procedures involve “issues of profound importance to the health care community and to the general public.” . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">However, the normal basis of tort liability can only be departed from when “public policy clearly requires that an exception be made.” . . . No such clear public policy exists to provide an immunity to Western Medical. In Wickline, there was a clearly expressed public policy reflected in the California Administrative Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code which mandated the use of a utilization review process. . . . Also in Wickline, there was a specific statute that provided for the denial of benefits to a person seeking acute hospital care when to do so was “ ‘in accordance with the usual standards of medical practice in the community.’ ” . . . There is no similar clearly expressed public policy which applies to the decedent’s contract with Alabama Blue Cross. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">240
As to all of the causes of action alleged against defendants, there are triable claims given the evidence cited in plaintiffs’ separate statements. We realize that the trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment in this case was heavily influenced by portions of the Wickline decision which quite frankly contained overbroad language and constituted dicta. However, it would be inappropriate for this court to allow errors in one of its own prior decisions to remain uncorrected in this case. . . . The judgments are reversed. This case is remanded.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">It should be noted however that corporate negligence based on utilization review is subject to a large loophole: the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In the 2004 case Aetna Health v. Davila (542 U.S. 200), the United States Supreme Court ruled that actions based on state claims against health plans provided by private employers were preempted by ERISA. Hence, the only remedies available to plaintiffs are those provided by ERISA—which include remedies offered in the contracts themselves or injunctions, but not compensatory damages to compensate those already harmed by a plan’s decision.</p>

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">We have seen a number of ways how hospitals, insurance plans, and managed care organizations may face corporate negligence liability. These organizations may be liable for inadequate selection, improper training, insufficient supervision, improper utilization reviews, and
241
other problems such as inadequate communication of medical information. So, what should a health care organization do to shield itself from direct liability?</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Recall that negligence liability applies when actors fail to take reasonable precautions. So, to shield itself, a health organization would like to establish what those reasonable precautions are, and to then ensure that those precautions are followed. In many cases, the best approach is to develop reasonable rules for conducting each of these aspects in the operation of the health care organization. Rules for selection, supervision, communication et cetera. These rules should then be communicated to all staff, and then appropriately enforced. They also should be reviewed from time-to-time to ensure that they reflect up-to-date best practices.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Development and implementation of rules will not always lead to a clear court decision. While it is strongly suggestive that a hospital that broke one of its own rules may have been negligent, it is not necessarily mandatory for a court to come to that conclusion. Meanwhile, a hospital may be held to a higher standard than that established by its rules: if these rules have been shown to be inadequate in the past, continuing to use them is not considered reasonable. With those provisos in mind, developing and implementing reasonable rules is still the best shield from direct negligence liability for health care organizations.</p>

In developing this policy, you should perhaps set a higher standard than that required by the current law.

sustainable policy, use a stakeholder approach to your development of this policy. In your group, assign different people to take different perspectives: one to be a patient; one to be a doctor; another to be an organization administrator; and yet another to be their lawyer and maybe another to be a technology person. Based on all of these perspectives, come up with a clear health organization policy to limit direct corporate negligence exposure.</p></div><div class="mt-16 border-2 border-indigo-400 bg-white p-12"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-10 border-b-2 border-indigo-500 pb-6"><i data-lucide="messages-square" class="w-10 h-10"></i><div class="flex-1"><h4 class="font-bold text-3xl">Discussion Posts</h4></div><span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-bold text-xl">5</span></div><div class="space-y-8"><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">1</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Dale Thompson</h5><span class="bg-purple-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Teacher</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">Val Popoca Diaz (She/Her)</div></div></div></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">2</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Val Popoca Diaz</h5><span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Student</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">Wilson vs. Blue Cross of Southern California , 222 Cal. App. 3d 660, 271 Cal. Rptr. 876 (1990)<br>Facts: Howard Wilson Jr. Was admitted to College Hospital in Los Angeles, CA. He was struggling with major depression, drug dependence, anorexia, and suicidal thoughts. His physician found that it would be best for him to do an inpatient program for three to four weeks to help treat him. Unfortunately, his insurance company, Blue Cross, refused to cover his stay. Therefore, since he was unable to afford it, he was asked to leave. Since he was unable to stay, he sadly committed suicide.<br>Issue: Whether Blue Cross violated its contractual obligations towards Wilson for treatment that was medically necessary, therefore breaching their duty.<br>Rule: Insurance companies must cover what is deemed medically necessary for patients, which is stated under the terms of their policies.<br>Reasoning:<br>Duty: Did Howard Wilson get reasonable care? Blue Cross had a duty to provide reasonable care, this included listening to physician recommendations.<br>Breach: Blue Cross breached its duty by refusing to cover the inpatient program, despite the physician’s medical recommendation. This denial of coverage effectively blocked Howard from receiving the treatment he needed, since he could not afford to pay out of pocket.<br>Causation: The breach caused Mr. Wilson harm. Since he was denied coverage by Blue Cross, he was prematurely discharged. Since he was denied care, he could not get the protection and medical support to keep him stable. The loss of treatment contributed to the suicide of Wilson.<br>Damage: the consequences of this breach are Wilson’s death by suicide.<br>Analysis: Blue Cross’ refusal to pay for Wilsons medically necessary in-patient service that was recommended by a physician is a breach towards their contractual obligations towards Wilson.<br>Dale Thompson</div></div></div></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">3</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Dale Thompson</h5><span class="bg-purple-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Teacher</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">Good job going through Duty / Breach / Causation / Damages here.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In addition to direct liability, hospitals may face tort liability under the agency legal doctrine of respondeat superior. Under this doctrine, employers face vicarious liability for the torts caused by their employees. The reason for this is due to the nature of agency itself. Agency occurs when a principal asks an agent to do something on their behalf, and the agent agrees to do so, under the control of the principal. The agent is understood as an extension of the principal, acting on their behalf and under their control. As a result, when an agent commits a tort, it can be understood that the underlying action behind the tort was on behalf of and under the control of the principal. Consequently, it is reasonable to impose vicarious liability back onto the principal. Equitable purposes are also served by extending the plaintiff’s opportunities for recovery of damages to additional parties who may have sufficient funds to properly compensate the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Proof of respondeat superior3 in general requires three elements: (1) The harm caused must be physical in nature, either to person or property; (2) The tortfeasor must be acting as an employee (sometimes called a “servant”), as opposed to an independent contractor; and (3) The tortuous action must be within the “scope of employment” of the employee. While the first element is generally straightforward, the other two are frequently not a case of “black and white” but rather of gray.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">243
In determining whether someone is an employee versus an independent contractor, the most important consideration is the type of control exerted. When a principal has a right to control “the physical conduct in the performance of the services”4 done by an agent, that agent is an employee. When control extends only to the particular output—what is done not how it is done, then it is more likely that independent contractor status will be found. Other factors to be considered include how payment is made—by salary or wage versus by output; who supplies the tools and place for the work; and the “skill required in the particular occupation.”5 Putting these together results in a somewhat fuzzy analysis of whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor. In general, it may be best to list what factors suggest employee and which suggest independent contractor, and then perform an overall analysis to identify which seems most applicable, while remembering that control is frequently the key.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The final step of the analysis is to determine whether the action that caused the harm was in the “scope of employment” of the employee. If the action is part of their job, then it is clear that it is in the scope of employment. But what if some action is not specifically required, but is related to the job? This leads to another fuzzy analysis of whether something is a “frolic” versus a “detour” from their stated job responsibilities. If an action is a “frolic,” it is not in the scope of employment, but if it is a “detour,” it is. Here, the primary difference between a frolic and a detour depends on expectations: “whether or not the master has reason to expect that such an act will be done.”6 In assessing the somewhat-fuzzy applicability of employee status and scope of employment, courts make a policy determination as to when employers are vicariously liable.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">244
A.Independent Contractor Versus Employee in the Health Care Context</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In the case of hospitals, the determination of scope of employment is normally straight-forward: if a health care professional is doing some action related to health care, then it is normally considered within the scope of their employment. Instead, more of the battle has been over whether health care professionals are considered employees of the hospital or a health maintenance organization.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Traditionally, nurses and administrative staff were considered employees of the hospital. In certain circumstances under the “borrowed servant” doctrine, a nurse could also become the temporary legal “employee” of the attending physician. Under this doctrine, while a nurse might have an employment contract with a hospital, nonetheless, the attending physician might have sufficient control over how the nurse would perform his or her job that the physician would be considered the employer of the nurse for the purposes of respondeat superior.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Meanwhile, the traditional view was that a private physician under contract with a hospital was considered an independent contractor.7 The reason for this was that the level of skill involved with the practice of medicine meant that the contracting hospital could not exert control over how the physician did her or his job. Additionally, courts sometimes relied on statutory prohibitions of the corporate practice of medicine to claim that hospitals and insurance plans could not be vicariously liable for the negligence of their associated physicians. Moreover, courts would sometimes apply the “captain of the ship” doctrine (frequently in conjunction with the “borrowed servant” doctrine), which said that the attending physician was in control over the entire treatment of the patient, and as such, the hospital could not be considered as vicariously liable.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">245
However, recent changes in the delivery of health care have meant that courts have been more likely to find contracting physicians to be employees. In many cases now, the choice of which doctor treats a patient is not made by the patient but rather by the hospital, plan, or employer. If the hospital is choosing the doctor, then it can no longer be said that the doctor is independent of the hospital. Meanwhile, the growing complexity of surgical teams with different members performing different functions (such as anesthesia) without the overall control of the attending physician, and with the overall responsibility for the composition of these teams resting with the hospital or HMO, such developments have also led to the increasing trend to holding health care institutions vicariously liable for the actions of all involved health care professionals.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In the following two cases, the plaintiffs want to hold their HMOs to be vicariously liable for the negligence of the treating physicians. In one case, the court finds that the physician is an employee of the HMO, while in the other the court finds that the HMO-doctor relationship is not that of master-servant.</p></div><textarea x-model="n['respondeat']"placeholder="Notes..."class="w-full mt-10 p-5 border-2 border-slate-300 focus:border-black focus:outline-none font-mono text-sm"rows="8"></textarea><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><button @click="goTo('overview')"class="px-8 py-4 border-2 border-black hover:bg-slate-100">←BACK</button><button @click="mark('respondeat');goTo('sloan')"class="px-10 py-4 bg-black text-white font-bold">CONTINUE→</button></div></div><div x-show="s==='sloan'"x-cloak class="fade-in bg-white border-2 border-black p-16"><h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-12">Sloan</h2><div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-10 space-y-6"><p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Sloan v. Metropolitan Health Council, 516 N.E.2d 1104 (1987)</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Metro is a not-for-profit corporation organized to provide a prepaid health care delivery plan, or, as it terms itself, a health maintenance organization. . . . Metro’s members pay a monthly charge, plus certain specified fees listed in a schedule; in return, they are entitled to specifically enumerated medical services. Metro advertises one complete system which delivers its members health care in return for prepaid payment. The member selects one of Metro’s staff physicians, who then treats the member, orders tests, prescribes medicine, or arranges for other professional care or hospitalization. It boasts of simplicity: one medical office, one phone number, and one medical record for each member. Metro physicians are on call 24 hours a day, every day, for emergencies involving members. All complaints are made to Metro, not to physicians. Enrollment in the plan is with Metro,</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">246
not the physicians. Billing is made by Metro, not the physician, and Metro has the right of subrogation.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The physicians who treat members are engaged by Metro by a written contract denominated as an “employment contract,” wherein Metro is labeled the “Employer” and the physician is called the “Physician.” The Physician is paid an annual salary, increased yearly and paid in biweekly installments, in addition to which he receives such fringe benefits as sick leave, life, health, and malpractice insurance, a tax-sheltered annuity, vacation pay, and professional leave. The Physician cannot engage in outside work without Metro’s consent.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Important here are the following clauses:</p>
<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 mb-4"><p class="mb-3">1.Employment.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Although the Medical Director is primarily responsible to see that the medical services required under contracts between the Employer and the Employer’s Metro-Health Plan members are carried out, the Physician while on duty will be responsible for the supervision and administration of the health services at the health facilities.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The Physician acknowledges that the Medical Director shall determine all medical policy matters and the Medical Director’s judgment, in the event of a dispute, shall be final. It is also understood that the Medical Director shall use his best efforts to periodically review policy matters with the Physician so that policies and administrative procedures developed by the Employer shall result from the collective ideas of all parties involved.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">247
The Physician agrees that he will execute the labors of his employment in a professional manner and will conduct himself in such a way as shall serve the best interests of the Employer, the Plan and the Plan members. The Physician will assure that the following objectives, by way of illustration but not by way of limitation, are implemented:</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">(a)sole utilization of problem-oriented medical records</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">(b)a team approach to health care, utilizing nurses, physician extenders and other para-professionals</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">(c)emphasis on ambulatory and preventive health care</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">(d)development and implementation of a regular internal assessment of quality of health care</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">(e)development and fostering of the total concepts of prepaid health care. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The Sloans, members of Metro since 1978, brought suit alleging a negligent failure to diagnose. . . . Metro claims that the physicians it employs are independent in their practice of medicine, and Metro does not control their judgment in diagnosis or treatment decisions. Physicians are reviewed periodically as a matter of quality assurance, they are not overseen for the purpose of questioning their conclusions, and Metro does not enjoy veto power over tests, diagnoses, prescriptions, or treatment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">[Relying on Iterman,] the trial court granted summary judgment to Metro on the basis that a corporation cannot be vicariously liable for the malpractice of a physician in its employment. The sole question here is the correctness of that ruling. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The entire rationale for the holding in Iterman is based upon the conclusion reached by the court that, since no Indiana statute existed at that time which permitted a corporation to practice medicine, a public policy existed prohibiting a corporation to practice medicine; thus, the doctrine of respondeat superior was inapplicable. We believe that
248
the Professional Corporation Act of 1983, totally abolished such a public policy if, indeed, it ever existed. . . . Under the Professional Corporation Act, . . . liability of the corporation is provided . . . [thus]: A corporation whose employees perform professional services within the scope of their employment or of their apparent authority to act for the corporation is liable to the same extent as its employees. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">As shown by the statement of facts, there is evidence that Metro’s staff physicians were under the control of its medical director, a physician, who policed medical services and established policy. His judgment was final. The circumstances establish an employment relationship where the employee performed acts within the scope of his employment. The employee-physician was supervised by a physician, not a layperson. . . . For the above reasons this cause is reversed, and the trial court is directed to overrule Metro’s motion for summary judgment.</p>

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary judgment in favor of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) and HMO Illinois, Inc.
249
(HMOI). The issue before this court is whether HCSC and HMOI may be held vicariously liable for the negligence of doctors under contract with them to provide medical services to the members of their health care plan.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The facts of this case are as follows: Gwendolyn Raglin (Raglin) became a member of HMOI through her employment and in June 1985, because of her membership in HMOI, became a patient of Pronger-Smith Medical Associates (Pronger-Smith), a medical group under contract with HMOI to provide medical services to HMOI members. A medical history taken in November 1985 revealed that Raglin had diabetes in her family history.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In April 1986 a pregnancy test confirmed that Raglin was pregnant and Pronger-Smith physicians Alfonso Mejia, Mario Irigoyen and Jose I. Manglano, provided Raglin with medical care throughout her pregnancy. Although these doctors were aware of Raglin’s medical history, which presented a strong likelihood that Raglin could develop diabetes during pregnancy, which in turn could lead to a larger than normal birth size baby, tests to monitor Raglin’s blood sugar were not performed.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On November 16, 1988, Raglin delivered a son, Gerik Raglin (Gerik). The delivery was complicated by a condition known as shoulder dystocia.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">C.No: Raglin v. HMO Illinois, Inc., 230 Ill.App. 3d 642 (1992)</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary judgment in favor of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) and HMO Illinois, Inc.
249
(HMOI). The issue before this court is whether HCSC and HMOI may be held vicariously liable for the negligence of doctors under contract with them to provide medical services to the members of their health care plan.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The facts of this case are as follows: Gwendolyn Raglin (Raglin) became a member of HMOI through her employment and in June 1985, because of her membership in HMOI, became a patient of Pronger-Smith Medical Associates (Pronger-Smith), a medical group under contract with HMOI to provide medical services to HMOI members. A medical history taken in November 1985 revealed that Raglin had diabetes in her family history.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In April 1986 a pregnancy test confirmed that Raglin was pregnant and Pronger-Smith physicians Alfonso Mejia, Mario Irigoyen and Jose I. Manglano, provided Raglin with medical care throughout her pregnancy. Although these doctors were aware of Raglin’s medical history, which presented a strong likelihood that Raglin could develop diabetes during pregnancy, which in turn could lead to a larger than normal birth size baby, tests to monitor Raglin’s blood sugar were not performed.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On November 16, 1988, Raglin delivered a son, Gerik Raglin (Gerik). The delivery was complicated by a condition known as shoulder dystocia. Apparently this means that, because of its size, the baby’s shoulders become lodged in the birth canal and caused delivery to be arrested. In response to this situation, Dr. Mejia applied pressure to Raglin’s abdomen and used forceps to assist the delivery. Because of this forced delivery, Gerik sustained permanent damage to his brachial plexis nerve resulting in paralysis.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On November 15, 1988, a medical malpractice action was filed against all of the above-named defendants for the alleged negligent medical care provided to Raglin during her pregnancy and for the negligent prenatal care and delivery of her son, Gerik. . . . HCSC and HMOI filed . . . a motion for summary judgment, [and] the trial court granted HCSC
250
and HMOI summary judgment in their favor. Plaintiffs now appeal from that order. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On appeal plaintiffs contend that summary judgment was improperly granted because a material issue of fact exists on the question of whether a principal-agency relationship, either actual or apparent, exists between HMOI and the doctors who deliver medical care to HMOI members.

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">It has been observed that a potential exists for HMOs to be held liable for medical malpractice based on one or more of several tort theories: (1) vicarious liability on the basis of respondeat superior or ostensible agency; (2) corporate negligence based upon negligent selection and negligent control of the physician; and (3) corporate negligence based upon the corporation’s independent acts of negligence, e.g. in the management of utilization control systems. . . . The only manner in which HMOI might be held liable for medical malpractice in this case is if it could be found vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a servant or agent, on the basis of respondeat superior or ostensible agency. Therefore, the real issue is whether, under the facts in this case, there exists any basis upon which to hold HMOI, and thus its parent corporation HCSC, vicariously liable for the negligence of the doctors who were under contract with HMOI to deliver health care services to HMOI members. This issue turns on the question of whether plaintiffs were able to show the necessary nexus between HMOI and the doctors charged with negligence.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In order to establish liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior one must show that a master-servant relationship existed between the parties and that the allegedly negligent activity was within the scope of employment. . . . In this case there seems to be no question that HMOI is an IPA model health maintenance organization and, therefore, does not directly employ its own physicians. Instead, HMOI contracts with
251
independent medical groups, who employ private physicians who maintain their own offices. Consequently, no direct master-servant relationship exists between HMOI and the physicians. For this reason the medical groups, and thus the physicians who work within the medical group, may be considered independent contractors with respect to HMOI and the doctrine of respondeat superior would normally not apply.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">However, we must consider whether there is a factual issue on the question of whether an agency relationship may be inferred, despite the legal relationship that exists between HMOI and the physicians. There are two avenues by which one may attempt to create a fact question on the issue of the liability of HMOI: (1) by a showing of implied authority, i.e., that the facts and circumstances indicate that HMOI actually exerted sufficient control over the physicians to negate the independent contractor status, at least with respect to third parties, . . . or (2) by a showing of apparent authority, i.e., that HMOI, by its actions or statements, led a third party, who may have been unaware of the independent contractor relationship, to believe that the physicians were controlled by HMOI. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In this case plaintiffs attempted to show that HMOI controlled, or retained the right to control, the medical groups and physicians with whom it contracted by virtue of the quality assessment and utilization review guidelines it promulgated in accordance with the HMO Act. . . . However, it is clear to this court that the Quality Assurance Compliance Program, with which medical groups and physicians contracting with HMOI must abide, is not the type of control from which agency arises.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The quality assessment program is really just a manner of tracking the independent medical groups to determine if they are complying with the rules and regulations of HMOI. Essentially, the independent medical groups and their physicians are required to provide documentation that they are following procedures designed to assure quality health care. HMOI, however, does not review the contents of the documentation to assess the accuracy of the medical diagnoses or
252
opinions, nor does it assume any responsibility for determining the correctness or appropriateness of the physician’s medical services delivered. HMOI plays only an administrative role, overseeing the process of health care delivery. Therefore, this court finds that, as a matter a law, this does not constitute the type of control necessary to impute an agency relationship between HMOI and the physicians. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Because we find that the trial court properly determined that no issue of material fact exists as to the question of an agency relationship between HMOI and the defendant-doctors, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>

<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Another way that a health care institution may be liable for the torts of its physicians and nurses is through the agency doctrine of “apparent authority,” sometimes referred to as “ostensible agency.”8 In agency,
253
apparent authority is most relevant in the context of a contract. Even though an ostensible agent might not have actual authority to agree to a contract, nonetheless, through apparent authority that agent may still be able to bind a principal to a contract with a third party. This happens when the principal makes manifestations that reach that third party, causing the third party to reasonably believe that the ostensible agent is authorized to bind the principal to a contract. Apparent authority exists in this case to protect third parties who may be misled by appearances that the principal is responsible for.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">While respondeat superior is the primary approach to torts under agency law, apparent authority can sometimes be applied to torts. § 267 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency states, “One who represents that another is his servant or other agent and thereby causes a third person justifiably to rely upon the care or skill of such apparent agent is subject to liability to the third person for harm caused by the lack of care or skill of the one appearing to be a servant or other agent as if he were such.”9 Thus, the requirements for the tort application of apparent authority are manifestations by the principal, leading the third party to a reasonable belief that someone is their apparent agent, followed by justifiable reliance by the third party. Note also that recovery against a health care institution under apparent authority is secondary liability: it will also require the proof of primary liability of the health care professional.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">While application of apparent authority is not typical in many torts that occur in business settings, courts do use it in health care. In the health care setting, a patient may come to a hospital for treatment, and be assigned to a particular physician. The specific contractual situation between the physician and the hospital may be such that the hospital does not have sufficient control over the physician to permit
254
application of respondeat superior. Nonetheless, to the patient, it may appear that because the hospital trusted this physician enough to make this assignment, the patient should then trust this physician. Because they therefore trust this physician, the patient will justifiably rely on the physician’s recommendations. Consequently, it seems equitable to impose some form of liability on the hospital for negligent actions of the physician. It is through apparent authority that this relief is offered.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In the following two cases, the courts examine whether the hospitals should be held liable for the torts of the attending physician under the doctrine of apparent authority, and find the hospital liable in one case but not in the other. You will see that in these cases, review of the underlying negligence of the physician is also a point of contention in examining an apparent authority claim.</p></div><textarea x-model="n['apparent']"placeholder="Notes..."class="w-full mt-10 p-5 border-2 border-slate-300 focus:border-black focus:outline-none font-mono text-sm"rows="8"></textarea><div class="mt-10 flex justify-between"><button @click="goTo('overview')"class="px-8 py-4 border-2 border-black hover:bg-slate-100">←BACK</button><button @click="mark('apparent');goTo('brownsville')"class="px-10 py-4 bg-black text-white font-bold">CONTINUE→</button></div></div><div x-show="s==='brownsville'"x-cloak class="fade-in bg-white border-2 border-black p-16"><h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-12">Brownsville</h2><div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-10 space-y-6"><p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Brownsville Medical Center v. Gracia, 704 S.W.2d 68 (1985)</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">This is a medical negligence case. Appellees sued numerous health care providers, including appellants, seeking damages for the alleged wrongful death of their child, and received judgment against appellants. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The record reveals the following: On July 16, 1979, appellees’ nine year old child was kicked in the stomach by another youth and soon thereafter began complaining about stomach pains. The next day, the child continued to complain about stomach pain, he “had a fever,” and he vomited “when he tried to eat” and when “anything just touched his stomach.” On July 18, 1979, the child “was the same, complaining about the same pain, and had the same symptoms,” so appellees took their child to a hospital in Matamoros, Mexico, where he was admitted and remained for approximately four days.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">On July 22, 1979, appellees discharged their son from the Matamoros hospital against medical advice because “there was never any change”—“he didn’t get any better.” Following the discharge, appellees took their child to the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">255
At the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center, the child was seen “around 7:00 or 8:00” p.m. by Dr. Elias Lorenzana, who physically examined the child and ordered certain lab tests and x-rays. During the examination, Dr. Lorenzana noted that the child was experiencing some mild tenderness in his right lumbar area, he appeared jaundiced, and his bowels were hyperactive. Because Dr. Lorenzana only spoke English and appellees only spoke Spanish, all communications between them was interpreted by a hospital nurse. According to appellees, Dr. Lorenzana told them that “it was nothing serious, it was a simple case of anemia.” Mrs. Gracia testified (1) that Dr. Lorenzana told her that they could take the child home, should place him on a bland diet and should take him on the next morning to Dr. Posnett, a pediatrician, (2) that Dr. Lorenzana never recommended that the child should be hospitalized and (3) that Dr. Lorenzana did not tell her that, if the child became worse during the night, she should return the child to the emergency room. However, Dr. Lorenzana testified and medical records indicated that the primary diagnosis was hepatitis caused by some type of infection. Dr. Lorenzana further testified that he recommended (1) that the child could go home and get some bed rest, (2) that, if the child were to feel worse during the night, the child should be returned to the emergency room and (3) that the child should “by all means” go see the pediatrician the next morning. Dr. Lorenzana stated that “they were given the option” to have their child hospitalized but that he felt that the child was not critically ill and did not require hospitalization at that time. Before he released the child, Dr. Lorenzana personally reviewed the x-rays taken, but he did not have the benefit of the radiologist’s report interpreting the x-rays until the following day. At the time he made his diagnosis of hepatitis, Dr. Lorenzana did not consider pancreatitis as a possible diagnosis and, after having reviewed the radiologist’s report the following day, he then considered appendicitis as a possible diagnosis. The radiologist’s report indicated that there were “some air filled slightly dilated small bowel segments in the right quadrant which may represent a localized ileus possibly due to appendicitis though clinical correlation is necessary.”</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">256
After appellees and their child returned home that evening, the child still complained about his stomach pain, his fever had diminished, but he “seemed to be doing a little better.” The child went to sleep that night; but, when he awoke “early” the following morning, he was feeling worse—he again had stomach pain and a fever.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">That morning, July 23, 1979, Mrs. Gracia took her child to Dr. Carlos Monarrez, a pediatrician, who examined the child and ordered certain lab tests and x-rays. After examining the child, Dr. Monarrez concluded (1) that the child had an “acute abdomen” with differential diagnoses including pancreatitis, hepatic abscess, appendicitis and typhoid fever and (2) that the child was “a very strong candidate for surgery.” From his office, Dr. Monarrez called a general surgeon, Dr. Raul Rodriguez, at Valley Community Hospital for surgical consultation. Dr. Rodriguez agreed to immediately see the child at Valley Community Hospital. According to Mrs. Gracia, Dr. Monarrez had told her that her child’s condition “was quite delicate and he needed surgery”; and, when he called “over there,” Dr. Monarrez “told them to prepare to take him into surgery right away.” The child was immediately taken by ambulance to Valley Community Hospital to be examined by Dr. Rodriguez.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Upon arrival at Valley Community Hospital at approximately 10:00 a.m. that same morning, July 23, 1979, the child was admitted through a “direct admission” process whereby he was taken directly to be examined by Dr. Rodriguez and then later to a hospital room. In the meantime, Mrs. Gracia provided admission-related information to a receptionist/clerk and a social worker at the hospital. At this time, Mrs. Gracia also signed a “Conditions of Admission” form. Minerva G. Coronado, the social worker, testified that Mrs. Gracia had been referred to her office for “financial evaluation” and that persons would be referred to her office “if they were not able to meet their hospital deposit or were having concerns over the hospital bill” and would be “screened for a possible referral to a financial resource.” During the interview between the social worker and Mrs. Gracia, it was determined that appellees did not have medical insurance and could not qualify for
257
financial assistance. The social worker also stated that “the doctors and nurses” were advised regarding the financial evaluation but that she did not make any recommendations regarding whether appellees’ child should have been admitted.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">While Mrs. Gracia was being interviewed by the receptionist/clerk and the social worker, the child was examined by Dr. Rodriguez, lab tests were performed, x-rays were taken, and the child was taken to a hospital room. Based upon the examination, it was Dr. Rodriguez’ impression that the child had suffered a “post-traumatic abdominal injury possibly associated with internal injuries relating to pancreas, liver or an acute inflammatory process, pneumonia, etc.” According to several medical experts, certain entries on the child’s medical records during this time indicated that the child was being prepared for surgery, but subsequent entries indicated that the child was being transferred to another hospital.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Subsequent to the child’s examination and Mrs. Gracia’s interview, the social worker visited Mrs. Gracia in the child’s hospital room. According to Mrs. Gracia, the social worker at that time (1) told her that they “did not qualify for the boy to stay there in that hospital,” (2) suggested that the boy be transferred to John Sealy Hospital (a public hospital) in Galveston and that “he would be better off in Galveston and it would be much cheaper” and (3) instructed that she “had to sign” the “Consent to Transfer” form, which “was already filled out.” According to the social worker, John Sealy Hospital in Galveston was “the place where we usually send people that cannot afford to pay.” The social worker and Dr. Rodriguez testified that the transfer was recommended only when Mrs. Gracia refused to sign a surgical consent form and “wanted to talk to her husband.” However, Mrs. Gracia testified that, if she had been presented a surgical consent form, she would not have refused to sign it and that she would not have waited to get the agreement of her husband. Mrs. Gracia also testified that she signed the “Consent to Transfer” form based upon the representations that her child would receive better care at better facilities with less costs at the Galveston hospital.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">258
Once Mrs. Gracia signed the “Consent to Transfer” form and a physician with the Galveston hospital agreed to accept the child, the social worker made all necessary transportation arrangements for the transfer, Mrs. Gracia contacted by telephone Mr. Gracia at his place of work and he came to the hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Gracia and the minor child were then flown by air ambulance to Galveston, where they arrived around “5:00” p.m. that same day, July 23, 1979, and were taken immediately by ambulance to the Galveston hospital. While in the care of the physicians and staff at the Galveston hospital and without surgical intervention, the child died approximately eight days later on August 1, 1979. The medical experts had different opinions about the cause of death. The exact cause of death was undetermined.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Subsequently, appellees filed suit against numerous health care providers, including appellants. Following severances and dismissals, appellees proceeded to trial in this cause against Dr. Lorenzana and appellants Brownsville Medical Center and Valley Community Hospital. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Based upon the finding of the jury, the trial court then rendered its judgment, which awarded damages in favor of appellees against Dr. Lorenzana, Brownsville Medical Center and Valley Community Hospital, jointly and severally, in the amount of $850,000.00 plus contribution rights, post-judgment interest and costs. Only appellants Brownsville Medical Center and Valley Community Hospital (and not Dr. Lorenzana) appeal from this judgment. We will consider Brownsville Medical Center’s appeal. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In its second point of error, Brownsville Medical Center asserts that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence was a proximate cause of the death of appellees’ child. The jury found that Dr. Lorenzana was negligent in (a) failing to properly or timely diagnose, (b) failing to properly or timely treat, (c) failing to administer appropriate medication, (d) not hospitalizing the child, (e) not consulting with a qualified medical
259
specialist and (f) failing to properly interpret the lab tests and/or x-rays. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to establish the foreseeability element of proximate cause because, after he referred the child to a pediatrician, Dr. Lorenzana could not have reasonably contemplated “the chain of events that actually occurred would unfold.” Appellant argues that “the actions which took place after [the child] left [Brownsville Medical Center] were a new and independent intervening cause” of the child’s death because (1) the chain of causation was broken since the intervention of the pediatrician and, subsequently, “the intervening situation at [Valley Community Hospital] operated independently of Dr. Lorenzana and was not a normal result” of Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence, but rather (2) the “failure to carry through with the treatment set in motion by” the pediatrician, and not Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence, was the “efficient cause” of the child’s death.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">There is medical expert testimony in the record to indicate that, at the time the child was examined by Dr. Lorenzana in the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center, (1) the child exhibited signs of appendicitis, as well as hepatitis and pancreatitis, and (2) the child’s x-rays, which were reviewed by Dr. Lorenzana prior to the child’s release from the emergency room indicated that the child had appendicitis. Also there is medical expert testimony to indicate (1) that the child should have been hospitalized for observation, (2) that, between the time of Dr. Lorenzana’s examination in the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center and the time of Dr. Monarrez’s examination at his office, the child’s abdomen became “acute” from a ruptured appendix or other organ and (3) that, if the child had been hospitalized and observed, the child’s “acute” condition could have been promptly ascertained and the child could have received prompt medical treatment, including possible surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">We find that, from the medical expert testimony, the jury could have concluded (1) that Dr. Lorenzana’s failure to properly diagnose and to
260
treat and/or hospitalize the child resulted in a delay of proper diagnosis and medical treatment (2) that, during this delay, the child’s condition, which was unsupervised, became aggravated or “acute” and (3) that the development of the child’s aggravated or “acute” condition, without supervision and prompt medical attention, may have hindered subsequent diagnosis and treatment. Also, we find that the jury could have concluded that injury to the child from Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence, as found by the jury, was reasonably foreseeable. In addition, based upon the facts of the case, we hold that, since the chain of causation was continuous and unbroken, Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence was a concurring cause of the child’s death and that the subsequent medical action or inaction did not constitute a “new and independent intervening cause,” which would excuse Dr. Lorenzana from liability. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to show Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence was a proximate cause of the death of the child. Brownsville Medical Center’s second point of error is overruled.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In its first point of error, Brownsville Medical Center asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s conclusion of law that Dr. Lorenzana was the “ostensible agent” of Brownsville Medical Center. The jury found (1) that Brownsville Medical Center held itself out to the general public as providing to the public reasonable emergency care services including the availability of reasonably competent emergency room physicians and (2) that appellees relied upon said representations by Brownsville Medical Center.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">An “apparent” or “ostensible” agent has been defined as “one whom the principal, either intentionally or by want of ordinary care, induces third persons to believe to be his agent, though he has not, either expressly or by implication, conferred authority on him.” . . . Restatement (Second) of Agency § 267 (1958) sets forth the following rule of “apparent” or “ostensible” agency applicable to this case. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The record reflects the following: Robert Carey, the administrator for Brownsville Medical Center, testified that his responsibilities included making the necessary arrangements for emergency room physicians to 261
be available at Brownsville Medical Center and that Brownsville Medical Center contracted with Dr. Brady Fleming to provide emergency room physicians to staff the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center. Dr. Lorenzana, the emergency room physician who saw the child at the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center, was hired and paid by Dr. Fleming. Dr. Lorenzana stated that, a person would seek treatment at the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center, he would never ask for an emergency room physician by name but rather would simply ask for a doctor to treat him. Dr. Fleming testified that there was no way for a patient who sought medical care at the emergency room of a hospital to know whether the emergency room physician was an independent contractor. Dr. Fleming further testified that Brownsville Medical Center directly billed patients for the services of the emergency room physician as well as other services.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Mrs. Gracia testified that the child was taken to the emergency room at Brownsville Medical Center “because we wanted him to have the best attention” and because she knew that there would be a physician to render treatment.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">After reviewing the entire record, we find that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s findings, upon which the trial court properly predicated its conclusion of law that Dr. Lorenzana was the ostensible agent of Brownsville Medical Center, and that, accordingly, Brownsville Medical Center was vicariously liable for Dr. Lorenzana’s negligence, as found by the jury. . . . Brownsville Medical Center’s first point of error is overruled. . . .</p>

Memorial Hospital System, 722 S.W.2d 746 (1986)</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">This is a case of man bites dog. Appellant, apparently angered by the barking of a dog in a parked truck, approached the truck and bit the dog. The owner of the dog, apparently angered by the unprovoked attack on his best friend, approached Appellant and broke his jaw. Appellant’s complaint however, is not against the dog or its owner, but instead Appellant sued Appellees for negligence in their care and treatment of his fractured mandible. The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of these Appellees, severed Appellant’s case against Dr. Naficy, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Appellant arrived at the emergency room of Appellee hospital (Appellees will hereafter be referred to collectively as “the Hospital”) on April 30, 1982. He had no family physician and requested that someone at the hospital recommend a doctor to treat him. Dr. Naficy, a physician who had staff privileges at that hospital was contacted and he admitted Appellant into the Hospital in the early hours of May 1, 1982. Dr. Naficy then performed a total of four operations on Appellant to repair his fractured mandible. During his hospitalization Appellant developed a tissue infection in his mouth and ultimately left the Hospital against medical advice on June 12, 1982. Appellant then sued the Hospital and Dr. Naficy for negligence in connection with the infection. He alleged the Hospital was negligent in recommending Dr. Naficy, in failing to keep his wound clean, in failing to keep his room clean and in failing to properly and timely change his dressings. He
263
further alleged Dr. Naficy was negligent in his treatment of the wound and the infection.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The Hospital filed a Motion for Summary Judgment alleging that the summary judgment evidence established as a matter of law that the Hospital was not vicariously liable for any negligence of Dr. Naficy; that the Hospital was not negligent in recommending Dr. Naficy, in keeping Appellant’s wound and hospital room clean, or in changing the dressings on Appellant’s wound. The trial court granted the motion. . . . Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in finding no material fact questions on the issues of the Hospital’s vicarious liability and its liability for its independent negligence. . . .</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Appellant relies heavily on Brownsville Medical Center v. Gracia . . . to support his argument that the evidence raises fact issues concerning the applicability of ostensible agency to the facts of this case. There are three essential elements which must be proven in order to establish ostensible agency: (1) The third party must have a reasonable belief in the agent’s authority; (2) The belief must be generated by some holding out by act or neglect of the principal and; (3) the third party must justifiably rely on the representation of authority. . . . The Gracia court found that the presence of all these factors raised a material fact question on the issue of ostensible agency.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The record in the case at bar reflects that there was no summary judgment evidence of these factors. The physician, Dr. Naficy, was not an emergency room physician. He was an independent physician with medical staff privileges which allowed him to admit and treat his private patients in the Hospital. There was no contractual relationship between Dr. Naficy and the Hospital. Dr. Naficy billed his patients directly for his services and received no remuneration from the Hospital. The Hospital made no representations to the public concerning Dr. Naficy. Further, Appellant was free to choose any physician to treat his condition. Appellant told “someone” at the hospital that he had no family physician and requested a referral. This unknown person gave him Dr. Naficy’s name as a doctor with privileges at the Hospital and,
264
upon Appellant’s request, that person contacted Dr. Naficy. Appellant did not receive treatment from Dr. Naficy in the emergency room. Also, Dr. Naficy admitted Appellant into the Hospital as his private patient. . . . We hold that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in which ostensible agency has been found. Appellant failed to raise a fact issue on each element of the affirmative defense of ostensible agency. Appellant’s first point of error is overruled.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">In his second point of error Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Hospital negligently failed to exercise reasonable care in recommending Dr. Naficy, and negligently failed to keep Appellant’s wound and hospital room clean and/or change the dressing on Appellant’s wound.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The Hospital presented the depositions of two physicians as summary judgment evidence. Dr. Maldonado is the oral surgeon who treated Appellant after he left the Hospital. Dr. Musher is a specialist in internal medicine and infectious diseases. Dr. Maldonado’s deposition negated Appellant’s allegations that the Hospital was negligent in recommending Dr. Naficy to treat Appellant. Dr. Maldonado stated that Dr. Naficy, as a plastic surgeon, had the necessary skill and knowledge to treat Appellant’s injury. He also testified that it was appropriate for a plastic surgeon to care for such an injury and that the surgical procedure performed by Dr. Naficy was the appropriate treatment for Appellant’s condition.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">The deposition testimony of both Dr. Maldonado and Dr. Musher negated the essential element of proximate cause with regard to Appellant’s contentions that the Hospital’s negligent care of Appellant caused or aggravated the infection in his mouth. They both stated that the infection originated from bacteria normally present in Appellant’s mouth and that it was not caused by any act or omission of the Hospital or its employees. Further, Dr. Musher stated that the condition of the hospital room had no effect on the infection and that any delay or failure to change the dressing or clean the wound had no relationship to the development or progression of the infection.</p>
<p class="mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">265
In response, Appellant presented no evidence that the Hospital failed to exercise reasonable care in recommending Dr. Naficy or that the Hospital breached any required standard of care. In fact, the only summary judgment evidence Appellant offered was his own deposition asserting his conclusions that the negligence of the Hospital caused his infection. In a medical negligence action, proximate cause is an element which must be proven by expert testimony. . . . Mere conclusions of a lay witness are not competent evidence and cannot be considered for the purpose of controverting expert opinion evidence.) . . . . The Hospital met its burden of negating the essential elements of each of Appellant’s causes of action. Appellant failed to meet his burden of producing controverting evidence to raise a fact issue on these negated elements. Therefore, the Hospital was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Appellant’s second point of error is overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>

Nicholson, lacking a family doctor, requested the hospital to recommend a physician to treat his injury. The hospital recommended Dr. Naficy, a private physician with staff privileges. Dr. Naficy admitted Nicholson as his private patient and performed four surgeries to repair the fracture. During his hospitalization, Nicholson developed a tissue infection in his mouth. Nicholson ultimately left the hospital against medical advice in June 1982.<br>Issue: Was the trial court correct in granting summary judgment for Memorial Hospital System by finding that the hospital was not vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of the independent physician, Dr. Naficy, because the plaintiff failed to establish the elements of apparent authority?<br>Rule: A hospital can be held vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor physician if the plaintiff establishes the three elements of apparent authority (or ostensible agency).<br>Reasoning: The court held that Memorial Hospital System was not vicariously liable for Dr. Naficy's alleged negligence because Nicholson failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish the three elements of apparent authority:<br>1.     Did the hospital hold the physician out as its agent? Nicholson failed to produce evidence that the hospital, through its actions or communications, specifically led him to believe Dr. Naficy was a hospital employee rather than an independent doctor with staff privileges.<br>2.     Did the patient reasonably believe the physician was the hospital’s agent? Although Nicholson asked for a recommendation, this request alone was not enough to create a reasonable belief that the recommended doctor was an employee whose care the hospital was guaranteeing.<br>3.     Did the patient rely on that belief? Because Nicholson did not sufficiently establish that the hospital held Dr. Naficy out as its agent (element 1) or that he reasonably believed he was an agent (element 2), the claim of reliance also failed.<br>Rule: the plaintiff must prove the hospital is liable if ostensible agency applies.<br>Reasoning: a hospital can be held liable for the negligence of an independent contractor physician if the plaintiff establishes all three elements of apparent agency.<br>Duty: Nicholson requested a recommendation, implying the hospital had a duty to provide a non-negligent agent.<br>Breach: the hospital was not in breach of duty by Dr. Naficy as Nicholson failed to produce evidence of ostensible agency.<br>Causation: Nicholson alleged the hospital’s independent acts such as cleanliness and improper dressing changes caused his infection.

On that, there are some key facts / conclusions from the court here: A. What does Dr. Maldonado's deposition concerning Dr. Naficy address in this proof of negligence? B. What about the depositions of both Dr. Maldonado &amp; Dr Musher, concerning the infection?  C. What about Dr Musher on the hospital room / dressing &amp; cleaning the wound?<br>Dale Thompson</div></div></div></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">4</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Dale Thompson</h5><span class="bg-purple-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Teacher</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">On E&amp;SC,<br>Good job here!

Charleston Community Memorial Hospital<br>Facts: The plaintiff is an 18 year old male who was taken to the emergency room of the defendant after breaking his leg in a college football game. Dr. Alexander, who was on emergency call, treated this with a plaster cast. After the cast was applied, the plaintiff complained of significant pain and their toes were swollen and dark in color. 2 days later, Dr. Alexander removed the cast with a saw, cutting the plaintiff’s leg in the process. The plaintiff was then transferred to Barnes Hospital, where it was determined that the broken leg had “a considerable amount of dead tissue” due to the lack of circulation of blood in the leg. The leg swelling with the constriction of the cast led to the leg being too far gone, and after several procedures in an effort to save the leg, it had to be amputated 8 inches below the knee.<br>Issue: Can a hospital be found negligant of care, independent of its physicians?<br>Rule: Yes, the hospital can be found negligent.<br>Reasoning: Hospital has a duty to oversee medical treatment provided within its’ facilities, this includes medical staff and proper procedures. In this case, the hospital staff not taking vitals or checking circulation of the leg as often as necessary shows a breach of this duty and therefore direct negligence. “Skilled nurses would have promptly recognized the conditions that signaled a dangerous impairment of circulation in the plaintiff’s leg (221)”<br>Analysis: The Hospital was found liable in damages done to plaintiff for reasoning that they provided inadequate supervising and monitoring of its medical staff resulting in the loss of the plaintiff’s leg below the knee.  Had this been the case, the plaintiff would have been much more likely to keep their leg and recover normally. The hospital owed the plaintiff a duty of care in ensuring competent staff and sufficient medical treatment, and breached this by failing to review the work of Dr. Alexander or provide a consultation. This directly caused the plaintiff to harm and damages in the loss of their leg.<br>Serenity Soulisak-Hoang</div></div></div></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">6</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Serenity Soulisak-Hoang</h5><span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Student</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">Ethical Consideration: Whether or not between institutional responsibility for patient safety and the professional autonomy of a physician<br>Relevant stakeholders: Dorrance darling and his family, Charleston Community Memorial Hospital, Dr. Alexander, Dr. Fred Reynolds, Barnes Hospital,<br>Tradeoffs: Prior to the case, it is in the perspective that a hospital is merely for doctors to practice medicine and that physicians were seen as independent individuals and that the hospital was not responsible for their negligence. However, this perspective was challenged in court and in favor of the jury that it is the hospital’s duty to oversee the quality of care provided by all its staff including physicians to prevent harm.<br>Recommendations: To ensure of providing quality of care, taking in account of supervision of medical staff, providing the medical staff as well as enforcing up-to-date standards and procedures will allow a system where the responsibility of the safeness of a patient is shared throughout not only the physician, but the hospital as well.<br>Dale Thompson</div></div></div></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border-2 border-slate-300 p-10 hover:shadow-xl transition-all"><div class="flex gap-6"><div class="w-20 h-20 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-2xl">7</div><div class="flex-1"><div class="flex gap-4 mb-5"><h5 class="font-bold text-xl">Dale Thompson</h5><span class="bg-purple-600 text-white text-sm px-4 py-1 rounded-full">Teacher</span></div><div class="text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">On E&amp;SC:<br>For stakeholders, don't forget future patients / doctors / hospitals.<br>You have a start on the tradeoff, but we'll get into that further in class.<br>On your recommendation, does making the hospital legally liable help in achieving better quality of care?
